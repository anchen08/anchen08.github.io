The website has lists of the various seeds that individuals can provide in their feeders and the various birds that those seeds will attract. There are also suggestions for trees and shrubs that can be planted to draw a wide variety of bird species. The City also recommends that the population take a look at the other requirements for successful habitat enhancement, including water sources, shelters, and provision of nesting materials. Knowing what birds are native and what these species require will draw an abundance of birds to a backyard and increase the enjoyment of the species.</p>
<p>The City of West Bend has contructed 20 blue bird boxes that we will be selling at our annual wildflower and native plant sale.  This educational table will teach the public about blue birds and what native plants should be planted to help attrack birds.</p>
<p>The City of West Bend provides several links for the citizens to connect with various resources to enhance the backyard habitat for birds:</p>
