The new comprehensive plan outlines Ashland’s values and how the City will work to protect and strengthen our natural setting and resources; our small city character and our sense of community; our heritage; our arts, architectural roots, and recreational assets; and our economic prosperity.</p>
<p>The full text of <em>Authentic Ashland 2035 – A Comprehensive Plan for the City of Ashland</em> is available <a href="http://www.coawi.org/DocumentCenter/View/195/Chapter-830-Ordinance-for-Authentic-Ashland-2035-Comprehensive-Plan-PDF?bidId=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online</a>.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The City owns over 30 acres of land within the “Bay City Creek” overlay district (lands within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of Bay City Creek), which runs from rural areas south of Ashland, through the City, and into the Chequamegon Bay of Lake Superior. The creek and its associated ravine form an oasis for birdlife and a major wildlife corridor within city limits, hosting black bears, bobcats, many migrant songbirds, and breeding birds such as Ruffed Grouse, Veery, Great Horned Owls, N. Cardinals, and various warblers.</p>
<p>In the next year, the City of Ashland will be undertaking several projects that will provide additional bird habitat and bird viewing area within the City limits. The Maslowski Beach Green Infrastructure Project, will implement green infrastructure BMPs to improve water quality and migratory bird habitat at Maslowski Beach. The Bayview Pier Project will replace the aging pier structure with a new ADA complaint walkway and pier for swimming, fishing and viewing. The first phase of the Ashland Ore Dock Project will also begin this fall with construction of community seating area near the entrance of the Ore Dock. The ultimate goal of this project is to gain access to the end of the Ashland Ore Dock for wildlife viewing, fishing and personal enjoyment.</p>
<p>The City of Ashland also worked with the Wisconsin DNR and USFWS to repair Tern Island in Chequamegon Bay in 2020. Tern Island is a terminus of the old oredock #3 and his home to 200 pairs of nesting common terns.

<li>Prentice Park is a 99-acre park with two (2) miles of primitive walking trails, camp sites, wildlife viewing platforms overlooking cattail hemi-marsh, artesian wells, head waters for one of the Fish Creek tributaries, and a wide range of forest types including lowland cedar, black ash swamp, aspen, and spruce. It is well-known as a premier birding hotspot in the area particularly for waterfowl and forest landbirds, especially during migration eBird shows an impressive 179 species for the Park but even this number is underestimated and easily surpasses 200 species through the past several decades based on data gathered via Christmas Bird Counts, May Counts, a formal Chequamegon Bay Waterfowl Survey conducted by local biologists, and extensive observations made by Northland College professor Dick Verch and his ornithology students.</li>

<li>Maslowski Park is located along the Lake Superior shore and includes three rock and sandy beaches that provide important loafing and foraging habitat for shorebirds, gulls, terns, and other waterbird Its offshore waters are shallow and relatively nutrient rich, attracting large numbers of Tundra Swans and diving ducks during migration. The park also includes a short trail through shrub wetlands leading to Prentice Park. With an eBird list of 135 species, it ranks among the best birding locations on Chequamegon Bay, particularly for shorebirds and other waterbirds.</li>

Up to 150 pairs nest here annually. The park’s offshore waters are also important for Common Loons and various diving ducks, especially during fall migration. Onshore, crabapple trees planted within the park attract Cedar Waxwings, Pine Grosbeaks, and other frugivores. No fewer than 119 species have been found here, according to eBird.</li>

<li>Part of the 11.5<strong> </strong>mile Ashland Rails to Trails System (ARTS), is the Waterfront Trail built on an old railroad bed that follows the shoreline of Lake Superior for almost 5 miles and traverses all stages of forest succession. Breeding species include American Redstarts, Yellow Warblers, Baltimore Orioles, Gray Catbirds, Warbling Vireos, Cedar Waxwings, and much more. During migration, these shoreline woodlands provide important habitat for migrating landbirds. Retention ponds along the route feature Sora and Virginia Rails, shorebirds, sparrows, blackbirds, and other migrants.</li>

<li>The Historic Soo Line Ore dock stretches out into Lake Superior 1700’ and was acquired by the City in June of 2014. The Public gained access to the first 800’ in August of that same year. eBird reports that 83 species have been already reported at the park. The majority are shorebirds (plovers and sandpipers), gulls, snowy owls, falcons, and various waterfowl in the water and air. Warblers, sparrows, finches, and other songbirds have been seen on the mainland where small woods occur.</li>
