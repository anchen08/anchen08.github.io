<p>The City works closely with the St. Croix Valley Bird Club (SCVBC) in promoting activities and enlarging habitat.

<p>In 2018, following several inquiries about beekeeping within City limits, the City of River Falls created a fact sheet and registration form that assists City residents in applying urban beekeeping best practices. This <a href="http://www.rfcity.org/DocumentCenter/View/3270/Beekeeping-Info-Sheet?bidId=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> was produced in collaboration with the St. Croix Valley Beekeepers Association (SCVBA).

Mr. Hanson was eager to have the St. Croix Valley Bird Club take over the monitoring of numerous nest boxes on his golf course. Jim reported that there were many wood nest boxes throughout the course, some needing extensive repair or replacement. Many of the boxes were poorly situated, located in an environment of thick vegetation more favorable to wrens and chickadees. It was identified that some of the boxes needed to be relocated to open areas more ideal for bluebird habitat. Jim spent several months repairing boxes and building new boxes to replace those in too rough of shape to repair. He also identified areas throughout the golf course that would be favorable for bluebirds, and collaborated with the Lead Groundskeeper of the golf course in the new placement of the nest boxes. Jim continues to actively monitors 35 nest boxes at this site as documented in criterion 1 B.                                                                        </p></p>

While our City of 15,000 has no existing bus system, it may be utilized in the future by various ride share or taxi services. The City also obtained a grant for a new taxi minivan as part of its own taxi service. While transit is not exceptional in many Wisconsin Cities, it is uncommon in smaller, rural communities, and River Falls is too far from the Twin Cities to be part of a greater transit network as this time. The City completed its first bicycle and pedestrian plan in 1995. In 2018, the City applied for and received a Transportation Alternatives Program grant from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation in the amount of $48,000 to write a new bicycle and pedestrian plan in the next few years. Many of the recommendations in the 1995 plan have been implemented. Most recently, the City completed two trail projects in 2017. One was a reconstruction project for a 700-foot section of Lake George Trail that connects Family Fresh (a grocery store) to Walnut Street. The other was a 1,500-foot trail extension that connects Heritage Park at Maple Street north to Division Street. In the fall of 2016, River Falls was designated a Bronze level Bike Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists. In 2019, the City wrapped up its Kinni Corridor Plan, which calls for additional bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in Downtown River Falls and along the Kinnickinnic River, which runs through the heart of the community. Finally, the City is rewriting its Comprehensive Plan in 2022-2023 that will likely recommend additional improvements in walkability, traffic calming, bike-ped infrastructure, and green infrastructure. Additional recreational trails are also planned for mountain bikes, neighborhood walks, and disc golf.  </p>

<p>The River Falls City Hall is the first in Wisconsin to be LEED Silver Certified. Sustainable features integrated in the design include: 70% of construction waste, a total of 55 tons, was diverted from the landfill by recycling; 4,003 tons (91%) of an existing building on the site and street demolition waste was recycled or re-used; high-efficiency boilers and chillers, a building automation system, and increased insulation should result in the building using 34% less energy than code requires; low-flow faucets and toilets use 20% less water than code and will save approximately 107,000 gallons of water annually; water-efficient landscaping, including native plants and prairie grasses, will reduce water needed for irrigation and protect the Kinnickinnic River, the Class 1 Trout Stream that runs through the city and is adjacent to city hall; the city will purchase 50,300 kWh, or 35% of its annual energy consumption from renewable sources; 22.8% of construction materials (by cost) contain pre-consumer and/or post-consumer recycled content; 26% of construction materials (by cost) were manufactured within 500 miles of the construction site, reducing energy consumption required to deliver the products; 75% of the wood used in the building came from sustainably grown forests; and building finishes, such as carpet and paint, are no-VOC or low-VOC (volatile organic compound) materials.</p><br><br><strong>4.3.4, Document that a municipal building is LEED certified (silver or higher)</strong><br>n/a<br><br>
