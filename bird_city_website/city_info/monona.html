As a practical matter it cannot “add bird habitat”, but it has protected a great deal of important habitat within the city limits.</p>
<p>The City of Monona recently applied for a native plant grant through Plant Dane which is facilitated through the Dane County Land &amp; Water Resource Department. The native plants that the City of Monona requested are for establishing a bird and butterfly garden in the North side of Winnequah Park by the lagoon. </p>
<p>The City of Monona has expended tens of thousands of dollars over the last decade or longer to restore Woodland Park to an oak savanna/woodlot. The city initially commissioned Scott Taylor to prepare a <a href="http://www.mymonona.com/325/Woodland-Park-Plan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Management Plan for that park</a> which the city has followed closely. Page 13 has particularly relevant detail regarding bird habitat:</p>

(Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Monona recently purchased the San Damiano property, it is currently maintained as a park. At just under 10 acres, and with nearly 1,500 feet of Lake Monona shoreline, the property known as San Damiano has been described as epic, iconic, and even magical. The property’s small arboretum of cedars, sycamores, oaks, pines, and apple trees serves as a haven for a wide variety of native and migratory birds, and at least one natural spring still gurgles beneath its topsoil. Perched atop a natural limestone bluff, the property offers breathtaking views of the Wisconsin State Capitol, and a peaceful natural expanse, amidst the bustling sprawl of Madison’s East Side.</p>
<p>Since acquiring the property, community members have been able to access the site for birding making it a hot-spot location on eBird. </p>
<p>The Parks Department worked to clear paths and trails for the public and creating an easily accessible bird viewing habitat.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection. (Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Monona is located on the Yahara River watershed and includes parks and shoreline natural areas on Lake Monona, the Yahara River, and Upper Mud Lake that provide valuable bird and wildlife habitat. The Monona Wetland Conservancy on the South Beltline, designated c. 1992, welcomes thousands of out-of-town visitors with a stunning view of this large wetland natural area and provides critical stopover habitat for thousands of annually migrating birds as well as native habitat for resident Wisconsin birds including keystone species as Bald Eagles and Ospreys. Sandhill Cranes nest in the Monona Wetland Conservancy and their calls can be heard at homes in the vicinity.</p>
<p>The City has also spent a number of years working to restore Woodland Park (see 1D below).</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Monona's Parks and Recreation Department implemented a native micro-forest in Winnequah Park in 2022. 45 trees were planted with a variety of the following species: Shagbark Hickory, Northern Catalpa, Yellowwood, Emerald City Tuliptree, Autumn Blaze Pear, Swamp White Oak, American Dream Oak, and Bur Oak. The tree selection reflects a natural forest setting while providing habitats for birds and other animals.</p></p>
