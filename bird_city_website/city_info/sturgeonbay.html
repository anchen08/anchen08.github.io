This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Sturgeon Bay originally adopted its comprehensive plan in 2010 and continues to support the quality of small-town character which is a balance between development and open space. The community is more intensely developed within the core, yet remains walkable, is built to a smaller, pedestrian scale, and includes significant public spaces despite the ever-increasing population. Conversely, open space is more dominant along the outskirts of the community. Development is well thought out and environmental features are preserved, and the land is generally more rural in nature. Our parks continue to be a main focal point. </p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Sturgeon Bay continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1994 and recently, our renewal application was approved for another year, 2021.

Chapter 20 of the City Ordinance is dedicated to preserving the natural state of scenic areas by providing parkland and open space, encouraging wildlife. The <em>Door County Zoning Ordinance</em>, which also covers the City of Sturgeon Bay, contains zoning ordinances protecting bird habitat. Chapter 2 is dedicated to wetland zoning and natural areas, while Chapter 5 is dedicated to woodlands. These chapters outline specific goals while highlighting the importance of preservation and enhancement of these areas. This directly gives legal protection to wildlife, such as birds, through habitat management and natural resource guidelines. City owned natural areas include Franke Park (8 acres), Lawrence Big Hill Park (5 acres), Woodside Wildflower Preserve (3 acres), and Little Creek Parkway (5.7 acres).

The Ahnapee State Trail is a 30-mile former railroad bed from Sturgeon Bay south to Algoma and Casco in Kewaunee County. The trail follows the meanders of the Ahnapee River along farm fields, meadows, marshes, bogs and grasslands. It's a quiet walk or bike ride through some beautiful habitat that attracts many interesting and colorful birds, as well as deer, fox and other native wildlife. Potawatomi State Park, located in Sturgeon Bay, is also included in this publication. Straddling the shoreline bluffs along the bay, Potawatomi State Park offers two miles of Lake Michigan shoreline dotted with granite boulders. The rocky bluffs and shorelines and deep, lush forests provide habitat for numerous species of native flora and fauna. Bird watchers and nature enthusiasts will find 9 miles of hiking trails that access this 1,225-acre property. Adjacent areas to the City of Sturgeon Bay include to the north, Whitefish Dunes State Park and Cave Point County Park which features picturesque limestone sea caves. Diverse habitats and a Great Lakes locale make birding on these properties ideal. You can find waterfowl of all kinds, Rough-winged Swallows, and Blue-gray Gnatcatchers. Sturgeon Bay, also, provides a 13.8 mile segment of The Ice Age National Scenic Trail, a thousand-mile footpath that highlights some of the state's most beautiful natural areas for hikers, wildlife and bird enthusiasts. </p>
