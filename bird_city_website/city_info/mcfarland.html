<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of McFarland approved a comprehensive plan in 2006 that is pursuant with the State of Wisconsin “Smart Growth” plan and has been in compliance since. Under the comprehensive plan rare species occurrences are identified and marked by the WDNR’s Natural Heritage Inventory, and thus have protection. Generally these areas are located in the southeast corner of the Village and along the Yahara River and Mud Lake. Key objectives of the plan include preserving streams, drainageways, floodplains, wetlands, wildlife habitat, steep slopes, woodland areas, and other natural features. Furthermore, the Village continues to recommend that environmental corridors and other key features be preserved and that they aid adjacent Towns, Dane County, and WDNR in preparing the conservation plan for the area containing the Door Creek wetlands, Lower Mud Lake wetlands, and surrounding agricultural land.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>As McFarland continues to expand, additional park areas must be acquired and developed. The Village has developed an extensively detailed master plan for Urso Community Park, which is adjacent to the conservancy lands to the south and west. From the perspective of biological communities, Urso provides a spectrum of community types including wetlands, open water, savanna, and oak woodland. The sites offer an excellent opportunity for restoration of high quality oak woodland, oak savanna, mesic and wet prairie, and wetlands. Public participation is also an integral part of the improving park areas. From public meetings and survey respondents priority has been placed on improving existing park facilities, expanding pedestrian and bicycle trail systems, and developing a management plan for conservancy areas. Preserving the natural features within Penitto Creek, Mud Lake and Door Creek watersheds are also deemed essential. Marsh Woods Park already has a detailed Assessment and Management Plan and provides ample habitat and sustainable resources for birds and other wildlife in oak-hickory woods, Sedge meadow, wet meadow and shrub-carr. McFarland Community Forest, in conjunction with the Township of Dunn, also has a Forest Stewardship Management plan detailing its 10 acres.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of McFarland continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation annually.

(Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>In early 2019 the Village of McFarland started construction on a disc golf course at Urso/Schuetz park. Primary steps included removing invasive understory and oak release of an approximately 8 acre oak woodland. Barred owls and Coopers Hawks are frequently seen utilizing these new areas. Additionally, the Village is currently restoring an additional 5.5 acres adjacent to the disc golf course. This land will be utilized to expand recreational activities including creating easily accessible bird viewing habitat.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection.

Invasive shrubs and trees have been removed from the site with continued efforts to managed invasive seedlings. Village Fire Department conducts prescribed burning. Some oak release has been done with continued monitoring of future removals being assessed. Future activities include herbaceous invasive species removal, continued prescribed burning, native shrub plantings and ground layer supplement seeding.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; display: inline; float: none;">Efforts from volunteers and Village staff have created habitat and hiking trails for park users. Trails have created access to Lower Mud Lake providing another excellent opportunity for waterfowl viewing.</span></p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong></strong></p><p>The Villages street tree planting program utilizes a high percentage of natives and cultivars of natives.

These Martin houses are common destination for park visitors to enjoy these wonderful birds. Purple Martin houses are located in four public parks in McFarland, with two next to our Bird Observation deck. A viewing benches are near all houses so citizens can sit and relax while watching the birds. In the fall of 2016, a new warming shelter was built with 2 large overhead glass garage doors that overlook Lower Mud Lake. Several citizens have taken advantage of this site to bird watch with their telescopes during inclement weather. In the fall of 2017 we received a donation of a new Purple Martin bird house from an involved citizen.</p><br><br><strong>2.1.1, Describe your community's educational program to control free-roaming cats and/or the manner in which you actively publicize the Cats Indoors initiative</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of McFarland regularly has an informational packet available at the Parks/Public Works Office on keeping cats indoors and the hazards free roaming cats pose to birds.
