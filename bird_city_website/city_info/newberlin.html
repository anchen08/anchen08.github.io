<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The City of New Berlin has a comprehensive plan that is in compliance with Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” law regarding land use planning and resource management. The plan, entitled <em>New Berlin 2020 Comprehensive Plan</em>, touches on multiple aspects of creating and protecting habitat.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The City of New Berlin was awarded a National Fish and Wildlife Federation (NFWF) Five Star Urban Waters Grant in 2018. The proposed project will cover 9.59 acres and encompass the length of Deer Creek and the wetlands to the south and east of the City Center Business District. Common to this area are several species of resident birds, migratory songbirds, owls and waterfowl. Recent history has revealed an abundance of whitetail deer and smaller animals such as muskrats, raccoon, opossum, skunks, various mice/voles and even evidence of a beaver. The habitat for these species is that of an urban to rural interface and wetland transition ecology. The current state of the defined proposal areas vary between ‘poor’ with construction debris, litter and heavily infested invasive species to ‘fair’ with few invasive species and nearly undisturbed lowland habitat, native trees and wetlands plants.</p>
<p>The project will connect two areas of current focused conservation activities. First, the Deer Creek Sanctuary is a parcel of 47 acres of upland mature oak and maple climax growth forest that has been involved in community conservation efforts from Scout projects, the Gering Trail and a native salamander study due to the vernal ponds. The other end of the project is the Preserve at Deer Creek and Eisenhower High (EHS) and Middle School. The Ecology Club at EHS most recently has created an ecological trail through the woods at the School and would like to expand their efforts north through the Golf Course and into the wetlands following Deer Creek to City Center. At City Center, there are efforts underway to benefit the environment with the Friends of the Library engaging with the Waukesha Green Team and several local civic groups to promote water conservation with a “Project Rainway” rain barrel auction, ABC Garden and bird habitat enhancement behind the new Library. This project would give a tangible point of consolidation for those conservation efforts and a community gathering point to begin and end the Wetland Ecology Trail. When complete, the project will remain sustainable with the committed involvement from the Scouts annual activities in Scout Park, coordinated monitoring by the New Berlin Land and Ecology Club and annual activities by the EHS Ecology Club. The City of  New Berlin Parks, Buildings and Grounds Department is the ultimate authority over this project and will maintain oversight of this area as identified in the Parks and Open Space Plan 2016. </p>
<p>To date, there has been a wetland delineation and there are several active volunteers working on other Grant components. In conclusion, this project will restore and make accessible to our public the Deer Creek corridor that flows through the most heavily urbanized area of the City of New Berlin. This project will establish a sustainable ecological trail with the use of variety of community volunteer groups and lay the foundation for additional community engagement and with the development and improvement of future park space and a means for the promotion of our local wetland ecology and bird habitats.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>New Berlin will be recognized as a Tree City USA for the 16th time by the National Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 2002. 2017 marked its fifth year as a recipient of the Growth Award for advancing forestry activities.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong></strong></p><p>City Forester, Paul Fliss graduated from the 2001-12 WCTMI Program and attended the 2016 WCTMI graduate class in Green Lake.</p></p>
