<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>In March 2009, the Janesville City Council approved the City’s comprehensive plan after more than two years of work by city staff, the plan commission, a consulting firm as well as discussion among residents and council members. The Plan provides recommendations in the areas of land use, transportation, economic development, parks and open space, historical and cultural resources, housing, community facilities, agricultural and natural resources, utilities, and intergovernmental cooperation.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Janesville, through the efforts of the Parks Department, provides bird habitat within “natural areas” locally known as the “Green Belt.”  These natural areas stretch 15 miles and essentially circle the City. Many are in the process of being restored to a natural prairie state. There are also 30+ miles of hiking trails and paths within the City, many of which run through or near Green Belt areas. Green Belts provide open space, encourage active and passive recreational opportunities, and preserve some of the native vegetation that once covered these important prairie areas. Green Belts support wildlife, natural prairie growth, trail use, enhance adjacent property values, and overall aesthetics. Future plans include planting additional prairie, prescribed burns, and trail improvements. Brochures are available.</p>
<p>The exposed Rock River edge after the removal of the Monterey dam (July 2018) has been restored with native plants, including a designated wetland area.  The exposed mud flats were attractive to shore birds.  Prairie restoration as of the fall of 2022 was in year two and has progressed nicely.  Waterfowl and other migratory bird species are more regularly observed.</p>
<p>Green-Rock Audubon Society is working with the City of Janesville to restore an area along Spring Brook at Main Street called "The Pond".  Ducks, geese, herons and other birds are present. This year a prairie restoration contractor completed reed canary grass treatment and fall seeding of native prairie seed. As of the fall of 2021 the reed canary has been greatly reduced and native plants are more abundant.</p>
<p> As a part of the reconstruction of a half-mile section of River Street in the central city, the City has added a diverse group of 70 trees and a rain garden in the area along the street and the river. All plantings provide nesting habitat and nearly half of the trees are a source of bird food.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Janesville continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 2004. It is supported by a resident committee – Janesville Urban Forest Alliance (JUFA). "The mission of the Janesville Urban Forest Alliance shall be to promote and enhance the beauty and general welfare of Janesville's urban forest." The current focus is to increase the diversity of trees, moving away from the dominant “maple” culture and replacing the tree canopy following the Ash Borer infestation.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong></strong></p><p>Ethan Lee, Janesville's forester, has a bachelor's degree from UW in Forestry.  He is a member of International Society of Arboriculture certification number - WI - 1082A</p></p>

<p>The Monterey dam was removed and as part of that project native species of trees and shrubs were planted along the rivers edge and open park spaces. </p>
<p>In 2021 the City installed a gravel bed for growing 5'+ tall bare root trees which are planted in the fall.  The initial planting was 50 trees, which was a huge success.  In 2022 the City is purchasing 150 bare root trees and expanding the gravel bed to allow for those additional trees.  The bed is a collaborative effort with JUFA who also uses the gravel bed to store their bare root trees that are later planted throughout the community as part of an urban reforestation effort.</p>

The City of Janesville has a cat “leash law” that requires any cat to be on a leash when off of the owner’s property. Enforcement of this ordinance is spotty at best.</p></p>
