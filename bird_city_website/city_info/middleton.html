<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>Avid bird watchers abound in Middleton and have been keeping detailed bird checklists for several of Middleton’s conservancies for many years. For example, Mike McDowell and partners have been monitoring birds in Middleton’s Pheasant Branch Conservancy monthly since 2007, and during that time have tracked over 160 bird species. Dedicated resident Robert Conhaim has for many years monitored Purple Martin nesting at Stricker Pond. Furthermore, the community provides a detailed bird species count conducted at the Pheasant Branch Conservancy yearly.</p>
<p>Madison Audubon Society (MAS) sponsors an annual birding field trip to Middleton Municipal Airport for counting grassland bird species. The next field trip was planned for June 2020 but was cancelled due to COVID-19. MAS is also monitoring a bald eagle nest in Pheasant Branch Conservancy that was discovered in February 2020. This is part of MAS’s Bald Eagle Nest Watch program. The nest in 2020 did not produce offspring. However, the adult pair incubated eggs and produced eaglets in 2021 and are being monitored by MAS. A viewing platform was set up to allow people to observe the birds at a safe distance with binoculars. MAS attended an educational event in May 2022 for Conservancy Day and provided viewing scopes.</p>
<p>Due to concerns by community birders that populations of grassland birds were declining in Pheasant Branch Conservancy, officials closed a number of trails in 20% of the Conservancy with the highest nesting sites of grassland birds. Dogs are allowed but must be on leash.</p>
<p>A 2019 WI Master Naturalist (course held in Middleton) capstone project organized a group of birding volunteers to survey the designated area for 8 grassland bird species of concern: Willow flycatcher, sedge wren, dickcissel, Eastern meadowlark, clay colored sparrow, grasshopper sparrow, vesper sparrow, Henlow's sparrow. This is an ongoing project to monitor the effectiveness of the dog policy in terms of increasing grassland bird populations. In 2020, the group surveyed the existing prairies of the Conservancy. In 2021 they also monitored 40 more acres that were seeded in winter of 2021 to see if the new prairie is helping provide habitat necessary to increase grassland bird populations. The group’s numbers have increased by two over 2020 making a total of 14 individuals monitoring grassland birds from the last week in April through the first week of September. The group is reporting out to the 2021 WI Master Naturalist course in Middleton as well as a Conservancy Days presentation. The hope is to educate the importance of maintaining and increasing these populations by protecting as well as increasing the habitat.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, a study by MAS volunteers resulted in delayed timing for cutting hay at the airport to allow grassland birds to fledge. Because of this data, when solar panels were being installed summer of 2020, MAS knew what birds were nesting in the area. They reached out to OneEnergy Development LLC for quality habitat mitigation which the company agreed to do. MAS provided the company with advice on native seed mixes to plant and outlining best management practices, such as delayed mowing to protect nesting birds. In May of 2022 birders conducted a survey of bird species at our airport to see if the solar panels had impacted the boblink population. They counted 133 individual birds, 21 species, and 20 boblinks (mostly male). Surveyors said that they suspected the females were nesting in nearby grass. A link to this eBird count can be found here: <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S109777064" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://ebird.org/checklist/S109777064</a></p>
<p>Students at Clark St. Community School (CSCS) in 2019 participated in MAS Bird Collision Corps (BCC) study at Kromrey Middle School. During spring and fall migration, students counted dead and stunned birds that had collided with the extensive windows facing the forest in the Pheasant Branch Creek corridor. The result of their study has resulted in writing a grant to obtain funds for remediation of those dangerous windows for birds. The application was interrupted during the pandemic. A video with instructions for constructing Acopian BirdSavors to apply to windows with high bird mortality was sent to Perry Hibner, Director of Communications for the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District for which the aforementioned schools are members. In 2020, a new elementary school, located at the Pope Farm Conservancy, was being built making the total number of schools in the district at eleven. Middleton High School (MHS) is also currently under construction to enlarge capacity. Hibner sent the video not only to the construction teams at Pope Farm and MHS, but also to the facilities services coordinator, as it would be his department that would have to implement the Acopian Birdsavers efforts or find something similar at Kromrey and other schools where there is an abundance of windows. The City of Middleton is also convening a task force to address bird strikes and possibly recommend the City pass an ordinance for new construction to have the type of windows that reduce bird strikes. In the interim, the sustainability coordinator for the City of Middleton has provided guidance to developers about bird friendly building design, using LEED Pilot Credit Bird Collision Mitigation requirements and guidance from New York City’s Bird Collision Ordinance language. The CSCS students continued in 2021 to monitor dead birds in a BCC study. The results of the BCC study were broadcast last fall to the community during a ZOOM presentation as part of the Friends of Pheasant Branch (FOPBC) Conservancy Days monthly event.</p>
<p>As part of World Migratory Day in 2021, members of the Friends of Pheasant Branch Conservancy took part in a Birdathon in Middleton as part of a team Flyin Solo. Members repeated this event in 2022 and raised over $1000 for bird conservation, and observed 46 species.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>In 2014, the City of Middleton adopted a Comprehensive Park and Open Space Plan to remain in effect through the year 2019. At 127 pages, this extensive document ensures that community planning occurs with bird habitat and open space in mind. This plan covers parkland as governed by the Parks, Recreation and Forestry Commission. The mission statement of Middleton’s Open Space Plan calls for preserving and protecting the City’s open space, water, cultural and natural resources, and the plan’s first goal is maintaining an adequate amount of active and passive recreational land, which includes acquiring additional acreage for parks and recreation.</p>
<p>While the Parks &amp; Open Space Plan includes conservancy lands, it does so only under the general analysis and master planning of public open space. Thus, a more comprehensive handling of conservancy lands can be found in the City of Middleton 2011 Conservancy Lands Plan. At the time of the Conservancy Lands Plan’s writing, conservancy lands covered over 800 acres, which represented approximately 15% of the City’s total area. By 2007, Middleton’s “green space” had increased to over 25% of the City’s area. The Conservancy Lands Plan acknowledges threats to conservancy lands including invasive species and development, and calls for measures like land acquisition to ensure viable conservancy lands long into the future.</p>
<p>Pheasant Branch Conservancy is a mix of woodland, wetland, and oak savannah and is managed by the City and adjacent Conservancy land is managed by Dane County. The Dane County unit of 160 acres that continues seamlessly from the City unit has just added an additional 160 acres by the purchase in 2019 of the Acker farm that shared a border with existing Conservancy land. The land has been seeded to prairie that will support a host of bird species including at risk grassland birds.</p>
<p>The grassland bird survey group (see B above) wrote a report and suggested habitat types/improvements to diversify grassland bird habitat for the new 160 acre addition to Pheasant Branch Conservancy being put into prairie over the next four years. Year one - 40 acres were seeded in winter 2021. This prairie is considered a platinum prairie because over 150 species were in the seed mix. Seed generated here will be used to improve habitat for birds in other Dane County properties with prairie.</p>
<p>Also, Rob Schubert with FOPBC has constructed a seed garden to add short grasses to improve the structure of the prairie to improve grassland bird habitat.</p>
<p>A WDNR grant was obtained to improve habitat for birds that nest or migrate through the marsh on a seasonal basis. The grant has been awarded to the FOPBC in 3 year cycles. The latest grant covers the 10th, 11th, and 12th year for improvements to habitat.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>2021 marked the 28th year that The City of Middleton was recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation.</p></p>

This flyer was sent to residential, industrial, and commercial addresses as part of their utility bill.</p>
<p>In the winter of 2021, a 40 acre portion of the recent 160 acre acquisition of Conservancy land was planted with high quality prairie species to support bird and wildlife. Volunteers then monitored these 40 acres to see if the new prairie is helping provide habitat necessary to increase grassland bird populations. The group’s numbers have increased by two over 2020 making a total of 14 individuals monitoring grassland birds from the last week in April through the first week of September.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection.

The Parks Ordinance also protects Middleton’s conservancy lands, including Stricker’s Pond, Tiedeman’s Pond, Graber Pond, Esser Pond and the famed Pheasant Branch Conservancy. In fact, Middleton can proudly say that over 25% of its land area is zoned as protected conservancy.</p>
<p>Due to concerns by community birders that populations of grassland birds were declining in Pheasant Branch Conservancy, officials closed a number of trails in 20% of the Conservancy with the highest nesting sites of grassland birds. Signs were posted to keep dogs on leash and an education effort was put forth to inform the public the importance of keeping dogs on leash to protect birds, dogs, and people. In 2021, a new Park Ranger for the Pheasant Branch Conservancy was hired in part to enforce dogs on leash. This position is shared with other Dane County parks in the area.</p>
<p>During sandhill crane nesting season, all boats are prohibited from the portion of Pheasant Branch Creek within this breeding and chick rearing area. Signs are posted to inform the public of the boating restrictions.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong></strong></p><p>Middleton has several robust restoration projects that are ongoing. Pheasant Branch Conservancy recently acquired an additional 160 acres, purchased by Dane County. 40 acres is currently being restored to high quality prairie. Bock Community Forest is a 19 acre site adjacent to the Pheasant Branch Conservancy that began restoration to Oak Savannah in 2006.

<p>In 2020, the City of Middleton partnered with Clean Lakes Alliance, Madison Audubon Society, Olbrich Gardens, UW Arboretum, WI Landscape and Nursery Association, Allen Centennial Gardens, Aldo Leopold Center, Friends of Lake Wingra, Weedman, and the Fund for Lake Michigan on a Resilient Landscape initiative to help homeowners make their yards and gardens more ecologically resilient. The intent is to improve lake water quality, provide habitat for pollinators and birds, and increase biodiversity on land that isn't public. This annual program will include a social media campaign, marketing materials, and eventually might include a designation granted to homeowners if they implement and report their actions. Partners came up with a list of 10 action items homeowners can take to accomplish these goals. The actions can be found <a href="https://www.cleanlakesalliance.org/top10/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=2020%20Resilient%20Landscapes%20-%20announcement&amp;utm_content=2020%20Resilient%20Landscapes%20-%20announcement+CID_8034e327f7a695e0d08c1ceb4dbcdc28utm_source=CreateSend%20email%20marketing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HERE</a>.  </p>
<p>In 2021, the City sent out 6200 utility bills with a flyer insert asking residents to plant native vegetation in their yards to provide bird and pollinator habitat. This flyer was sent to residential, industrial, and commercial addresses as part of their utility bill.</p>
<p>In 2022, Middleton participated in No Mow May suspending its nuisance ordinance for grass and plant height in lawns. The Sustainability Committee is working to amend the ordinance to allow native plantings and tall grasses/plants year around. This will be coupled with an education initiative to help homeowners select and care for native plantings that provide habitat for birds and pollinators and promote reduced mowing schedules that allow small flowering plants to grow in the grass providing food for pollinators.</p><br><br><strong>1.4.1, Show that your community offers the public information on how they can control and remove invasive species in order to improve or maintain bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Middleton provides an ample amount of information about the identification and removal of invasive plant species. This information is available <a href="http://www.ci.middleton.wi.us/index.aspx?NID=313" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the City’s website</a>. Additional links to related invasive species information can be found on the previously mentioned website as well under the Forestry heading.</p>
<p>The Friends of Pheasant Branch Conservancy have work days for volunteers to remove invasive plants and have information on their website for identification purposes. The FOPBC hosted a talk in January 2019 by wildlife expert, David Drake. The topic was landscaping for wildlife in your yard. Drake provided information and resources for how people can make their suburban yards and neighborhoods more attractive to and more beneficial for wildlife.</p>
<p>Kromrey Middle School, on the banks of Pheasant Branch Creek and woodland, has extensive rain gardens that provide habitat for birds. In the fall and spring of 2017-2022, 325 sixth grade students from Kromrey Middle School learned about native and invasive plants. They learned, with the help of naturalists, to identify select plants, the importance of natives and why invasive removal is desirable. They were trained to remove invasive species and then either planted or seeded bare spots.</p><br><br><strong>1.4.2, Demonstrate that your community offers a program for private property owners who are interested in dealing with invasive plants that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.4.3, Show that your community works on public lands to control invasive species that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Management plans and invasive species control is a key part of City Conservancy Lands management.

<p style="line-height: normal; background: white; margin: 5pt 0in;">The Friends (FOPBC) has an education coordinator and field trip program for students not only in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School district but for neighboring districts, scout programs and home schoolers. The elementary program provides enrichment for science units in the areas of water, plants, soil, ecology, and forests. The middle schools and high school teachers work directly with the coordinator to provide a field trip that is custom made. For example, the high school field biology class learns about identifying native and non-native invasive prairie plants and does a survey of abundance and distribution. The spring of 2019, the class was trained by Dane County naturalist Rob Schubert to identify prairie plants and invasive species, some techniques for invasive removal, and ideas for diversity and habitat improvement. The students in small groups had to work in an area of limited diversity and decide a course of action for improvement.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal; background: white; margin: 5pt 0in;">The FOPBC received a grant to work with 4K teachers in writing sandhill crane curriculum. The Pheasant Branch Conservancy has a “crane cam” (wildlife camera) positioned in the marsh for viewing cranes, ducks, geese and other birds of the wetland. The 4K curriculum incorporates the camera when learning about cranes. Students in the fall are involved in seed collecting and fifth graders have been involved in garlic mustard removal.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal; background: white; margin: 5pt 0in;">MHS photography students during their nature photography unit, take photos in the Conservancy and upload up to five photos each in the FOPBC photo contest.

For example, Mike McDowell and partners have been monitoring birds in Middleton’s Pheasant Branch Conservancy monthly since 2007, and during that time have tracked over 160 bird species. Dedicated resident Robert Conhaim has for many years monitored Purple Martin nesting at Stricker Pond. Furthermore, the community provides a detailed bird species count conducted at the Pheasant Branch Conservancy yearly.</p>
<p>Madison Audubon Society (MAS) sponsors an annual birding field trip to Middleton Municipal Airport for counting grassland bird species. The next field trip was planned for June 2020 but was cancelled due to COVID-19. MAS is also monitoring a bald eagle nest in Pheasant Branch Conservancy that was discovered in February 2020. This is part of MAS’s Bald Eagle Nest Watch program. The nest in 2020 did not produce offspring. However, the adult pair incubated eggs and produced eaglets in 2021 and are being monitored by MAS. A viewing platform was set up to allow people to observe the birds at a safe distance with binoculars. MAS attended an educational event in May 2022 for Conservancy Day and provided viewing scopes.</p>
<p>Due to concerns by community birders that populations of grassland birds were declining in Pheasant Branch Conservancy, officials closed a number of trails in 20% of the Conservancy with the highest nesting sites of grassland birds. Dogs are allowed but must be on leash.</p>
<p>A 2019 WI Master Naturalist (course held in Middleton) capstone project organized a group of birding volunteers to survey the designated area for 8 grassland bird species of concern: Willow flycatcher, sedge wren, dickcissel, Eastern meadowlark, clay colored sparrow, grasshopper sparrow, vesper sparrow, Henlow's sparrow. This is an ongoing project to monitor the effectiveness of the dog policy in terms of increasing grassland bird populations. In 2020, the group surveyed the existing prairies of the Conservancy. In 2021 they also monitored 40 more acres that were seeded in winter of 2021 to see if the new prairie is helping provide habitat necessary to increase grassland bird populations. The group’s numbers have increased by two over 2020 making a total of 14 individuals monitoring grassland birds from the last week in April through the first week of September. The group is reporting out to the 2021 WI Master Naturalist course in Middleton as well as a Conservancy Days presentation. The hope is to educate the importance of maintaining and increasing these populations by protecting as well as increasing the habitat.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, a study by MAS volunteers resulted in delayed timing for cutting hay at the airport to allow grassland birds to fledge. Because of this data, when solar panels were being installed summer of 2020, MAS knew what birds were nesting in the area. They reached out to OneEnergy Development LLC for quality habitat mitigation which the company agreed to do. MAS provided the company with advice on native seed mixes to plant and outlining best management practices, such as delayed mowing to protect nesting birds. In May of 2022 birders conducted a survey of bird species at our airport to see if the solar panels had impacted the boblink population. They counted 133 individual birds, 21 species, and 20 boblinks (mostly male). Surveyors said that they suspected the females were nesting in nearby grass.

<p>Students at Clark St. Community School (CSCS) in 2019 participated in MAS Bird Collision Corps (BCC) study at Kromrey Middle School. During spring and fall migration, students counted dead and stunned birds that had collided with the extensive windows facing the forest in the Pheasant Branch Creek corridor. The result of their study has resulted in writing a grant to obtain funds for remediation of those dangerous windows for birds. The application was interrupted during the pandemic. A video with instructions for constructing Acopian BirdSavors to apply to windows with high bird mortality was sent to Perry Hibner, Director of Communications for the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District for which the aforementioned schools are members. In 2020, a new elementary school, located at the Pope Farm Conservancy, was being built making the total number of schools in the district at eleven. Middleton High School (MHS) is also currently under construction to enlarge capacity. Hibner sent the video not only to the construction teams at Pope Farm and MHS, but also to the facilities services coordinator, as it would be his department that would have to implement the Acopian Birdsavers efforts or find something similar at Kromrey and other schools where there is an abundance of windows. The City of Middleton is also convening a task force to address bird strikes and possibly recommend the City pass an ordinance for new construction to have the type of windows that reduce bird strikes. In the interim, the sustainability coordinator for the City of Middleton has provided guidance to developers about bird friendly building design, using LEED Pilot Credit Bird Collision Mitigation requirements and guidance from New York City’s Bird Collision Ordinance language. The CSCS students continued in 2021 to monitor dead birds in a BCC study. The results of the BCC study were broadcast last fall to the community during a ZOOM presentation as part of the Friends of Pheasant Branch (FOPBC) Conservancy Days monthly event.</p>
<p>As part of World Migratory Day in 2021, members of the Friends of Pheasant Branch Conservancy took part in a Birdathon in Middleton as part of a team Flyin Solo. Members repeated this event in 2022 and raised over $1000 for bird conservation, and observed 46 species.</p><br><br><strong>3.7.1, Resolution: Attach a copy of your community's officially enacted resolution.

<p>The<strong> FOPBC Naturalist Clan</strong> hit the trails of Pheasant Branch Conservancy in 2022, tallying up <strong>46 species! </strong>Their team represents the staff and volunteers of the Friends of Pheasant Branch Conservancy. They spent their day surveying the property they protect! Despite some drizzly weather, they had fun finds including <strong>Black-and-white Warbler</strong>, <strong>Ovenbird</strong>, and <strong>Indigo Bunting.</strong> Their team captain, Cayla, is dedicated Birdathoner (formerly of last year's team Flyin' Solo) and this year she recruited others to help bird for a cause! It paid off, because the FOBPC Naturalist Clan has raised <strong>over $1,000</strong> for bird conservation, half of which will go back to the Conservancy and support their mission. You might have seen Pheasant Branch mentioned in many of our other team recaps—it's a popular Dane County birding spot for good reason, and we're grateful for everything Friends of Pheasant Branch does to protect it. View their team page here: <a href="https://charity.pledgeit.org/t/BfPd6aEUl9?utm_source=Master+List&amp;utm_campaign=bdfeb9f1a1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_07_30_06_02_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_72d6771e0d-bdfeb9f1a1-112889085" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://charity.pledgeit.org/t/BfPd6aEUl9?utm_source=Master+List&amp;utm_campaign=bdfeb9f1a1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_07_30_06_02_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_72d6771e0d-bdfeb9f1a1-112889085</a></p><br><br><strong>3.7.3, Show that your community participates in the Natural Resources Foundation's Great Wisconsin Birdathon to raise money for your community and for statewide conservation</strong></strong></p><p>The City Sustainability Committee hosts bi-monthly Sustainable U virtual meeting events that cover a wide variety of sustainability topics.

A plan with detailed recommendations was produced, and the City has been working to complete the actions over the past two years. Much of the plan has been implemented. Middleton has completed a city-wide LED light conversion, upgraded HVAC equipment, and installed solar on three municipal buildings in 2021. The City also allocated money for three more solar installation in 2022. The plan's policy recommendations are also nearly complete with Sustainability Guidelines working its way through the editing process in 2022. Middleton is collaborating with other Dane County municipalities and its utility MGE to convert our streetlights to LED bulbs.
