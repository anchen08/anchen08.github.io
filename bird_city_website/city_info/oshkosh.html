<h4>Limiting or Removing Threats to Birds</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>University of Wisconsin Oshkosh Grounds Manager working with a Winnebago Audubon member (Anita Carpenter) continues to maintain and add additional native prairie plantings and other natural landscaping on the campus. In 2017 they erected 10 Wren and Tree Swallow houses and 3 Wood Duck houses. They also added a brush pile which was used by many birds!  In 2018, they erected 5 additional Wren/Tree Swallow/Bluebird houses plus continue to add and maintain rain gardens and other native plantings.</p>
<p>In 2019, UW Oshkosh added 2 Screech Owl nest boxes, 2 Eastern Phoebe nesting platforms bringing the total number of bird houses to 21.</p>
<p>In 2020, UW Oshkosh added bat houses.  Our Winnebago Audubon member confirmed the following nests on campus:  warbling vireos - 2, Eastern kingbird - 1, and barn swallows - 5. The barn swallow nests were in a parking ramp that received very little use in 2020 which might explain why the barn swallows used this site for the first time.</p>
<p>In 2021, UW Oshkosh added a purple martin house and beehives.</p>
<p>Evergreen Retirement Community added a native prairie planting on their campus along a trail that is open to the public. Educational signage will be added in 2022.</p>
<p>Begun in the fall of 2011, the Millers Bay Shoreland Restoration Project continued with Phase II in 2012, and received a “You Make a Difference” community award from the Oshkosh Collaboration Work Group. The project brought together neighbors of Menominee Park as well as representatives from Winnebago Audubon, Wild Ones Fox Valley Area Chapter, Winnebago County Land and Water Conservation Department, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, UW-Oshkosh Student Environmental Action Coalition, students and staff from Oshkosh North High School, Winnebago Lakes Council, and UW Extension. The shoreland restoration project features 15,000 square feet of lake frontage near Ames Point and an additional 300 sq. ft. near the Melvin Avenue pump house in Menominee Park, and addresses a community need highlighted in the 2010 City of Oshkosh Millers Bay Aquatic Management Plan, which stated, <em>“The shoreline is incredibly poor and provides no aesthetic habitat or buffering value to the bay.”</em>  The area is now creating a natural buffer zone along the shoreline which provides food, shelter and nesting sites for birds in addition to other benefits. In 2022, the Millers Bay Shoreline Restoration project canged its name to Oshkosh Ecological Restoration and has continued to work with volunteers to maintain, improve and clean-up these sites.</p>
<p>The City of Oshkosh has partnered with the Menominee Park Zoo in seeking to provide additional bird habitat.</p>
<p>Work has been completed (2021) to update the lagoon at South Park in Oshkosh which provides additional bird habitat.</p>
<p> </p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong></strong></p><p> Beginning in 2015, Bluebird Restoration Association of Wisconsin member, Dave Misterek, erected 20 Bluebird houses and has continued to monitor the Bluebird nest box trail at Utica Golf Course near Oshkosh. Winnebago Audubon supports this effort and has offered field trips to the site.

<p>Bluebird nesting boxes in Menominee Park - Three Eastern Bluebird nest boxes were installed in 2021 in native plant sites along Miller’s Bay in Menominee Park and continued to be monitored weekly by volunteers for nest activity from March through August. Successful tree swallow nests were observed.</p>
<p>Skylight Nest Box Study Report - Kira Stark and Dr. Memuna Khan of Ripon College: Skylight nest boxes have been recommended as a house sparrow deterrent by Dean Rust, former president of the Pennsylvania Bluebird Society.  Skylight nest boxes have a small plexiglass window on the roof of the box. BRAW asked Ripon College to test this idea with a scientific study. They hypothesized that all the species would prefer the opaque, “normal” box to the skylight box.  This summer with the help of 32 citizen scientists, mostly BRAW members, they executed the first year of the Skylight Nest Box Study. The study spanned 19 counties (including Winnebago County - UW Oshkosh site) and consisted of 83 nest box pairs, one each with a skylight or an opaque roof. Boxes were installed 3 feet apart and oriented in the same direction. Volunteers monitored the boxes weekly and reported the nest box status with a weekly report form. Once a bird had made a nest and laid at least one egg, the other box was made unavailable. The occupied box remained unavailable until the occupied box’s nest had fledged. House Sparrows were managed by oiling eggs and removing eggs and nests once the eggs became cold. They oiled the eggs to maintain incubation behavior of the female sparrow and prevent the pair from seeking a nest box elsewhere on the trail. All species preferred the standard opaque houses over the skylight nest boxes.  They observed that 88% (73/83) of all nesting activity occurred in opaque roofed boxes. House Sparrows and native species exhibited similar preferences. House Sparrows exhibited nesting activities in 47 locations and used skylight nest boxes only twice. Eastern Bluebirds never used a skylight box, while Tree Swallows nested in skylight boxes six times. In three of these instances, a House Sparrow was occupying the opaque roofed box but had not laid an egg.  These results are suggestive that native species will tolerate skylight boxes when competition with House Sparrows is intense. Now that they have established the preference between the two boxes, they plan to continue the project for another summer.  They are currently designing this new study to assess if native species are more likely to successfully nest in skylight boxes if it is the only choice available.  </p>
<p>In 2022, the Utica Gold Club bluebird nest box trail was monitored weekly by Dave Misterek (BRAW volunteer) and his wife from April through August. Out of a total of 43 bluebird houses on this trail only 12 of them were occupied by bluebirds.  The total bluebirds fledged from these houses was 43 compared with 126 tree swallows fledged. The golf club owner and staff are very supportive of the trail and the golfers take interest in it.  </p><br><br><strong>3.7.1, Resolution: Attach a copy of your community's officially enacted resolution.
