Each year a few select public prairies and grasslands undergo prescribed burning to increase plant diversity, control invading woody plants, release nutrients into the soil, improve space and light conditions for native plants and attract wildlife.</p>
<p>In 2016 the City of Fitchburg completed a Forest Management Plan for the City’s largest park complex – McGaw Community Park and Seymour Johnson Neighborhood Park. The plan calls for restoration of oak savanna and prairie habitats which will result in more habitat for birds.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Fitchburg continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in1997 and has received 11 Growth Awards.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community.

(Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>As recommended in the Fitchburg Comprehensive Plan and delegated by state law, the city of Fitchburg continues to enforce its Wetland Zoning ordinance. One of its purposes is to protect bird and other wildlife habitat by preserving wetlands. The ordinance allows for wildlife habitat improvement and the establishment of wildlife preserves. The city cannot rezone a wetland if it may result in significant adverse impact to wildlife habitat.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong></strong></p><p>The City’s <a href="http://www.fitchburgwi.gov/679/Rain-Gardens" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> provides homeowners with information on the benefits of rain gardens and how to design and construct them on their own property.

In 2017, the following areas were burned: Briarwood Park and Harlan Hills Prairie Park. Volunteers participated in collecting native seed at The Nature Conservancy managed prairie remnants.  These seeds were used to over seed the prairie areas of McGaw Park, Harlan Hills Prairie, and Briairwood Prairie. Volunteers have also given their time to continue restoring City woodlots by removing invasive herbaceous and woody species from the understory and planting native trees and shrubs using tools and materials provided by the City.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong></strong></p><p>In general, the majority of street and park trees planted annually are hardwood trees of native varieties and cultivars. There have also been some specific projects, such as the spading of six medium-sized hardwood trees (dbh from 9 - 12 inches) from the Verona Road construction project. Rather than removing these trees, they were spaded and planted in a nearby parks to replace trees lost to emerald ash borer or other construction projects.</p>
<p>In addition to removing invasives from woodlots, volunteers have been filling in the understory with native trees and shrubs. This year, a dozen oak seedlings were planted at Nobel Woods. At both Seminole Glen Park and the Quarry Hill Fenceline, the following trees and shrubs were planted: Musclewood (x8), Serviceberry (x4), Common Witchhazel (x4), Nannyberry (x4).</p>
<p>Although actual planting will begin in 2015, the City has been working with the public to develop a restoration plan for the Tower Hill Greenway. Current plans include continued invasive understory management and the planting of native conifers and shrubs.</p></p>
