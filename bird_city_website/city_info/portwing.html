The project reclaimed the former sewage lagoons. A new system was installed a few years ago and it was porposed to rebuild the former site. The Park and Recreation Board suggested adding features to encourage bird watching and the DNR grant writer agreed. The DNR rep, Michelle Wheeler, and Town Board finished the work that begin in 2018, in the summer of 2019.  Project Objectives: </p>
<p>Prevent the spread of invasive plant species, especially reed canary grass into existing sedge meadow communities. Maximize restoration of sedge meadow habitat. Provide some open water to provide access from Bibon Lake for fishery spawning and rearing habitat. Provide small patches for scrub shrub habitat (and use of berm material). Provide access via small boat to Bibon Lake. Provide public access and observation area for bird watching.</p>
<p>In 2020 more work was done on the wetland reclamation project. Native grasses were planted on the new berm bordering the wetland. Street signage was added in the spring of 2020 helping to direct the public to this new area. The access road is named Wheeler Drive after Michelle Wheeler the DNR project coordinator who passed away shortly after completing the project. </p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has managed 233 acres of the Port Wing Boreal Forest as a State Natural Area (SNA) east and west areas since 1979. From the DNR website regarding the boreal forest SNA, “Port Wing Boreal Forest encompasses two areas of northern dry-mesic forest on sand spits inland from the present Lake Superior shoreline. The forest has distinct boreal characteristics. Large white and red pines (to 30” diameter) form a canopy over white spruce, balsam fir, red maple, white birch, mountain maple, yellow birch, and white cedar. The ground layer contains blueberries, twinflower, yellow blue-bead-lily, large-leaved aster, three-leaved gold-thread, and several club-mosses. Resident birds in the forest are very diverse and include Veery, Solitary Vireo, Northern Parula, Blackburnian Warbler, American Redstart, Purple Finch, and White-throated Sparrow.” Trails through this SNA are prohibited, however, there are public roads at their borders that allow hiking. A recent fire in the eastern SNA required the DNR to forge small trails for fire fighting equipment. Documentation at the site now indicates that hikers may use the trails but motorized vehicles are still prohibited. Birders often use Big Peter Road, which borders the SNA, as a bird-watching trail.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong></strong></p><p>The Town of Port Wing is working with the Department of Natural Resources to reclaim the town's old sewage lagoons. (This project was delayed in 2018 but was completed 2019) The purpose of the restoration is as follows:</p>
<p>The Town of Port Wing (the Town) previously utilized sewage treatment ponds that were constructed in a slough of the Flag River estuary, and near the Port Wing Boreal Forest State Natural Area. When the ponds were abandoned as part of a facility upgrade, the sewage sludge was removed and pond dikes were breached.  The restoration of hydrological conditions and the reestablishment of native vegetation were beyond the scope of the upgrade project. Funding support was awarded to the Town to develop restoration design plans for the project through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The Town retained Stantec in fall 2016 to develop those plans.  A Project Team of the Town, WDNR, and Northland College established project goals/objectives that meet local community and natural resource needs for the site as follows:    </p>
<p>Project Goal: Restore wetland habitat that is hydrologically connected to the Flag River wetland complex and Lake Superior. </p>
<p>This project implemented the preferred restoration approach designed by Stantec at the site. The project included: 1) off-site disposal of the berm material and on-site re-use of the berm material for construction of an observation area and improved public access, 2) re-grading the site to depths that will support sedge meadow communities, and 3) distribution of salvaged organic topsoil to provide a seed bank for revegetation. </p>
<p> Site development continued in 2020 with plantings and access road refinement.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

In 2020 the issue of cutleaf tessel arose again and in new areas. Removal was managed by Bayfield County when they were informed. The Park Board Chair also receives regular emails from Ramona Shackleford, Northwoods Cooperative Weed Management Area Coordinator, which discusses current issues regarding invasives.</p>
<p>2020 was a difficult year to work together. Information about invasive plants was disseminated via the Park and Recreation FaceBook page this year.</p>

The Park Board is also maintaining a Facebook page and is part of the Town website as a way to educate residents about our parks, invasive plants in our area and planting native species and encouraging ongoing maintenance of new plantings. This list of native species is now published to the Port Wing Park and Recreation Facebook page and Town website to help local residents easily acquire native plantings.</p></p>

The Port Wing Area Business Association (PWABA) has historically organized a one-day celebration to participate, along with other communities surrounding Lake Superior, in honoring our community's connections to Lake Superior. The international organization that has traditionally sponsored this day on the third Saturday of July has lost its funding. The PWABA has decided to continue the tradition on its own. Each year’s activities include presentations by local authors, beach restoration (pulling knapweed), National Fish hatchery exhibit, lectures by bird experts, paddle board demonstration, informational tables for Preventing Window Strikes, Keeping Cats Indoors, and Migratory Bird information and education are attended to by volunteers helping with the day's activities. Each year's events are planned in March or April and birding in the Port Wing area is a major focus.</p>
<p> 2020 plans were scrapped because of Covid-19, except there was a knapweed pulling event. We will anticipate having an event in 2021with the afore mentioned activities. Additionally, there will be demonstrations of the new app/device that the South Shore School is using with students in regards to the Field Edventures grant they received. This will enable residents to follow student's missions on a variety of public lands around Port Wing.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane43"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_43"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_43"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_gallery cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_245"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_245" id="cblabcbfv_245"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong></strong></p><p>The Port Wing Area Business Association is continuing to develop their <a href="http://portwingwi.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, which currently has links to the following articles: </p>
