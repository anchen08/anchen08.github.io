The City and Town of Bayfield have more Travel Green certified businesses than any other community in Wisconsin. The City’s website has a link to an article called “<a href="http://www.cityofbayfield.com/eco-municipality.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">It’s Easy Being Green</a>” that endorses green landscaping for historic properties:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Using native plants in your historic landscape design has benefits that go beyond complementing your building’s historic character, however. Local and regional plantings have evolved and adapted to local climate and conditions. They often perform much better with less water than plantings that have been transported from other locales. There is a term for this approach to landscape design, and it is called xeriscaping. It is the landscape equivalent of the philosophy of sustainable design for buildings. The idea is that in typical conditions the only water these plants should require, after propagation, is that which is supplied by rainfall, and that they are adapted well enough to their environment not to require chemical inputs. Using native plantings has the benefit of helping to maintain the genetic diversity against invasive species, and it also helps to maintain appropriate levels of birds and insects that have evolved in conjunction with the plants.</p>
<p>The website also features a link to an <a href="http://www.cityofbayfield.com/eco-municipality.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earth Care publication</a> that encourages city residents to install rain gardens, <em>“These gardens, which are filled with native plants, also become attractive areas of landscaping in home yards, inviting birds, butterflies and other wild species.”</em></p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Bayfield continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 2000.</p></p>

The Bayfield Regional conservancy manages trails on a 35-acre parcel on the edge of the Big Ravine and the Brownstone Trail that follows the old railroad right-of-way leading into Bayfield. The Bayfield Heritage Association manages the Fountain Garden Park at the south entrance to the city. The Bayfield Memorial Park along the city’s lakefront is managed by the Bayfield Civic League.</p>
<p>City ordinances also mandate the protection of park property:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No person shall kill, injure or disturb or attempt to injure or disturb waterfowl, birds or animals, wild or domestic, within any park…No person shall climb any tree or remove flowers or fruit, wild or cultivated, or break, cut down, trample upon, remove or in any manner injure, deface, write upon or ill use any tree, shrub, flower, flower bed, turf, soil, sand, fountain, ornament, building, structure, apparatus, bench, table, official notice, sign or other property within any park.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

In addition, the City also hired Bay Area Environmental to remove buckthorn off of the Brownstone Trail and plant native plants in its place. WIth the removal of buckthorn and planting of native species, it allows birds more nutrious food than buckthorn and decreases the chances of birds becoming weak and spreading seeds. </p><br><br><strong>1.5.1, Implement a municipal moratorium on the trimming of trees and shrubs and the mowing of ditches, storm water retention basins, and other grasslands from May 15 to July 15 to prevent the destruction of active bird nests. (Exceptions: invasive species control and public safety)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.5.2, Implement a tree-risk policy that includes specific plans to leave dead trees standing as nesting and foraging resources for birds when it is safe to do so (follow Urban Tree Risk Management, especially pg. 153)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.6.1, Demonstrate the implementation of a program to preserve Chimney Swift nesting and roosting sites (preferred) and/or to construct Chimney Swift towers</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Bayfield Carnigie Library underwent construction in 2021 on their chimneys. The original plan was to have the chimneys capped since they are not in use and retain moisture; however, around 10 chimney swifts have been seen above the library for 2 years now and this would eliminate their habitat. In order to help preserve roosting sites for swifts, the library board contacted the WI Chimney Swift Working Group to see what they would recommend. If the chimneys needed to be capped, a 12" clearance on the cap was recommened for enough access. It may discourage some of the birds, but it is better than covering them completely. </p>
<p>This resulted in a $2,500 order change for the renovation and the libary board agreed to and encourage the libary director to ask for donations. The Chequamegon Audubon Society donated $750 and around the small Bayfield communty, more than $1,500 was raised! Posters were put up and donation jars were avaliable and it got a lot of people in town talking about the swifts! </p>
<p>The caps were installed in July of 2021 and there have still been sightings of the swifts above the libarry since then. We're very hopeful that they come back in the spring! </p><br><br><strong>1.6.2, Document the establishment of a program to promote the conservation of Purple Martins through research, state-of-the-art management techniques, or public education</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.1.1, Describe your community's educational program to control free-roaming cats and/or the manner in which you actively publicize the Cats Indoors initiative</strong></strong></p><p>We have an ordinance (126-6 C.) that restricts animals (dogs and cats) from running at large.
