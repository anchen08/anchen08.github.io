The natural features of the area are woodlands and wetlands, with Rice Lake frontage on two sides of the parcel.  In 2018 our Community Services Department took up the task of removing invasive species from the sanctuary. Buckthorn and Black locust trees were completely taken out of the park and in 2019 new native trees were planted in the park. </p>
<p>Along with our designated “Bird Sanctuary Park,” the City of Rice Lake has also put forth city ordinances that offer additional protection to birds:</p>

This resolution was recertified on February 9, 2021. A new resolution will go before the City Council on February 14th, 2023.</p>
<p>In 2022 the City of Rice Lake held a WMBD celebration at the Rice Lake Public Library. During this time participants were able to play a game that put them on the wings of a migrating bird traveling back to Wisconsin from its winter grounds. The event event also saw the return of the "The Great Rice Lake Bird Search".. Participants in the search were asked to visit local parks, water ways, and green spaces and locate ten birds. They were than to document the bird in a bird book provided by the city. Once ten birds were located, participants were entered into a drawing to win a bird feeder and bird food donated by a local business. </p>
<p>The City of Rice Lake will be holding its annual WMBD celebration on May 13th, 2023. This year we are working with <a href="https://hunthill.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hunt Hill Audubon Sanctuary</a> and offering a presentation from one of their birding experts called "The Birds We Share". Following is a brief summary of the presentation:  </p>
<p>"Spring marks the arrival of some of the brightest birds like the Baltimore Oriole, Indigo Bunting, Scarlet Tanager, and many more. These tropical travelers migrate around 3,000 miles from their winter homes in Central America to their breeding grounds in Wisconsin. Join Sage Dunham of Hunt Hill Audubon Sanctuary to learn about the incredible journey that these birds take and how you can spot these birds in your own backyard!"</p>
<p>This event will also see the return of the very popular "Great Rice Lake Bird Search" .. The presentation will run from 11am-12pm, and the bird search booklets will be handed out after the presentation.
