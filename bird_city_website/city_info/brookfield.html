To accomplish this, the department uses a variety of tools and techniques. One of these tools is pesticides.</p>
<p>     Pesticides are used to protect the city’s landscape assets from loss due to diseases, insects, weeds and other pests, and to maintain the parks in a condition that is expected by the users. Pesticide use is governed by federal and state laws and regulations which the division complies with at all times. In addition, it is the department’s position that a responsible approach to pesticide use in the landscape is essential and desirable. Therefore the department holds to three fundamental concepts in its pest control operations.</p>
<p>     First, the department follows a “least use” policy. It strives to minimize the need for pesticides by using a holistic approach known as The Plant Health Care Management System or PHC. PHC is a strategy that utilizes all available management techniques together, rather than separately, to maintain plant health. These tools and techniques may include proper plant selection, tolerance of low pest levels, use of resistant plant varieties, improvement of the environment, alteration of maintenance procedures, use of mechanical controls and use of chemical controls. PHC minimizes the need for pesticides, but they are still a necessary component of a PHC program. It must be recognized that the suburban landscape can be an artificial environment. The pest control systems that exist in natural settings can be missing here. To maintain the parks and environment at the level desired by the residents, there is sometimes no alternative but to use pesticides.</p>
<p>     Second, the department follows a “least risk” policy when selecting and using any pesticide. This policy states: “If a pest control action involving a pesticide is deemed necessary, the department will use the pesticide or formulation posing the least risk to applicators, the public and non-target organisms which still provides adequate control of the pest.” If the department determines that a particular pesticide poses too great a risk regardless of safety precautions taken, it will discontinue use of that pesticide even if an equally effective alternative does not exist. As a result of this policy, parks and recreation has reduced its use of traditional pesticides in a favor of “bio-rational” pesticides such as soaps, horticultural oils and biologicals.</p>
<p>     Third, the department provides extensive training to its application personnel to assure that a pesticide is applied safely and correctly. The department requires that all full time employees be certified as pesticide applicators by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection in category 3.0 (landscape and ornamental). Each crew is given a training session prior to any spray operation detailing requirements and procedures specific to that particular program or pesticide.</p>
<p>     The department recognizes that the public has a right to know when and what pesticides are being used. The department routinely provides the public with information about its spray programs through press releases to the media whenever a major pest control operation begins. State law now requires the posting of small signs on treated areas following pesticide applications. Large signs are used where there is the possibility of higher concentrations of people.</p>
<p>     Brookfield, Parks, Recreation &amp; Forestry believes that pesticides plan an integral part in the management of park vegetation. Reductions in pesticide use can be achieved through alternative management techniques. However, indiscriminate reduction or elimination of pesticides will have three serious potential consequences:</p>
<p>Pest control will be significantly more expensive because of the inefficiency of alternative methods and the increased labor, equipment and material costs of those methods. A lower quality landscape will result and therefore a decreased level of service will be achieved because the effects of alternative methods tend to be less uniform and complete. Greater losses of landscape plants, turf, and their associated benefits will result where no or inadequate non-chemical pest control methods exist.</p>
<p>In summary, the Parks, Recreation and Forestry Department takes an approach to pesticides that reflects the current demands and concerns of the residents of the City of Brookfield, while continuing to be responsive to changes in public opinion, governmental policy, and environmental technology. The department remains a leader in safe and environmentally sound management of the parks and city landscape.</p></p>

<h4>Public Education</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>3.1.1, Document and describe your event that incorporates the annual WMBD theme in some fashion. If the event has not yet occurred, please share your detailed plans. For information on the current year's theme and event materials, please visit the World Migratory Bird Day website. To see what other Bird City communities have done in the past, please visit our website</strong></strong></p><p>The first Saturday in June (7:30 am – 12:00 pm), the City of Brookfield celebrates WMBD at the Brookfield Farmer’s Market in a cooperative effort with the Village of Elm Grove, a nearby Bird City. For the past several years, WMBD has been held at the Farmer’s Market to reach a larger audience, as the market is well-attended. This educational event allows residents to ask questions about birds, to learn ways to help conserve birds and establish backyard habitat. A number of handouts are also available. In 2021, a local ornithologist joined the Bird City committee and added a number of displays to the WMBD event. In 2022 we invited a birder from Elm Grove to work with us. In 2022 our displays included bird migration routes and stopover sites, ways to prevent bird window collisions, feeding birds by planting native plants and helping birds that nest in holes or cavities. For the “Dim the Lights for Birds at Night” 2022 theme, we provided information on preventing light pollution and examples of the kelvin scale to encourage attendees to decrease the brightness of their outdoor lighting. As in 2021, Wild Ones: Native plants, Natural landscapes, exhibited next to our WMBD booth so attendees could learn more about native plants and ask questions. Wild Birds Unlimited also had a nearby exhibit. The 2022 event was well-attended and people were very interested in learning more and asking questions. We look forward to improving the event in 2023.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane43"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_43"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_43"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_gallery cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_245"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_245" id="cblabcbfv_245"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong></strong></p><p>Brookfield makes its <a href="http://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/726/Wildlife-in-Brookfield" rel="noopener" target="_blank">conservation-oriented web links</a> easier to find than many community web sites.
