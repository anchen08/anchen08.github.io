<p>A $2,500 grant from the American Transmission Company has been received by Three Lakes.  The funds were used to plant energy saving and pollinator friendly native plants in the open space created by the remodeling of the public Demmer Memorial Library and the newly reconstructed Three Lakes Community Building and town office building in 2019.  The landscaping includes trees, shrubs, and vines as well as pollinator friendly bushes such as ninebark and viburnum.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong></strong></p><p>In June 2016, Three Lakes began work establishing two of four demonstration sites in and around Three Lakes where native plants favored by pollinating insects such as bees and butterflies will be planted to increase insect numbers and improve the ecosystem. Three Lakes continues to support the pollinator program.  Oneida County has also become involved.</p>

<p>In 2019 American Transmission Company (ATC) has awarded a grant for planting projects on public property, outside the rights of way.  Vegetation funded through the Community Planting program requires that communities plant trees outside of high-voltage transmission line rights of way.  Low growing, compatible vegetation funded through the Pollinator Planting program allows entities to cultivate species that benefit pollinator food and habitat.  This grant will be used for the landscaping between the public library and the Three Lakes Community Building.</p>

It consists of 50 percent open peat wetland (poor fen) and 50 percent forested tamarack/black spruce wetland with the 120-acre Rice Lake and 1.3 miles of shoreline on 1,800-acre Thunder Lake. The whole property is open for hunting except for the waterfowl closed area around Rice Lake. A wide variety of wetland wildlife use the property including Mallards, Blue-winged Teal, Ring-necked Ducks, Great Blue Herons, Sandhill Cranes, Canada Geese and numerous species of wetland songbirds. Three rare species, the Nelson Sharp-tailed Sparrow, Merlin, and the Yellow Rail nest on the property. Common mammals include white-tailed deer, beaver and muskrats.</p>
<p>One Stone Lake Hemlocks State Natural Area</p>
<p>Situated along the northern boundary of Thunder Lake Wildlife Area and the Rice Lake natural area, One Stone Lake Hemlocks supports stands of mature mesic forest with some old-growth characteristics. The canopy is heavily dominated by hemlock with associated species of yellow birch, sugar maple, and white cedar. A few super-canopy white pine are present. Most canopy gaps contain sugar maple; however hemlock is reproducing well near the lakeshore and locally through the site. The herbaceous layer varies from sparse to luxuriant. Characteristic species include Canada mayflower, intermediate wood-fern, shining clubmoss, American starflower, three-leaved goldthread, and wood sorrel. This site is part of one of the largest wetland complexes within the north central region. Surrounding One Stone Lake are extensive, open peatlands including open bog, muskeg, and poor fen which support good populations of area sensitive peatland birds. The forested wetlands also include extensive good quality stands of white cedar and black ash with tamarack being locally important. This entire area has been identified as a Land Legacy site. One Stone Lake Hemlocks is owned by the DNR and was designated a State Natural Area in 2010. (From the Wisconsin DNR website)</p>

This is a cooperative program between Oneida and Vilas Counties to combat terrestrial invasive species. In 2013, Three Lakes received a grant to map the invasive species along the nearly 130 miles of town roads. With this important information, the Natural/Cultural Resource Subcommittee created a terrestrial invasive species management plan for the town crew and notifies property owners who have terrestrial invasives on their property with a spec sheet to aid in the identification and explaining ways to eradicate the problem species. This could become the model for other communities to develop their invasive species management program.</p>
<p>The Three Lakes Chamber of Commerce and the Demmer Memorial Library distribute literature on both aquatic and terrestrial invasive species.
