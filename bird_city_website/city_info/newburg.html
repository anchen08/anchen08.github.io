<p>The skies are safer for migrating birds thanks to the dedication and exceptional efforts from the following organizations. These companies have chosen to follow the Wisconsin Humane Society's Wildlife Rehabilitation Center guidelines and reduced the chance of birds being injured by employing light reductions at night and using products specially designed to stop daytime collisions.</p>
<p>Riveredge Nature Center</p>
<p>The Riveredge Nature Center in Saukville, Wisconsin minimizes or extinguishes night lighting between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. during migration periods (mid-August through October, and mid-March through May). They also reduce perimeter lighting and reduce daytime collisions by applying window clings, CollidEscape, or BirdScreens, etc.to windows.</p></p>

Friday morning hikes with Paul Boyer give them the opportunity to see new birds arriving daily from migration. Citizens can meet birders and ornithologists at a bird banding station and see the birds up close as they were banded during the N.J.C. Bird Club Birdathon/Bandathon in mid-May. They even may get to release a bird back into the wild at this event. The Birdathon/Bandathon has been designated as Newburg’s IMBD celebration.</p>
<p> The Village of Newburg has chosen May 8, 2021 to celebrate International Migratory Bird Day at Riveredge Nature Center. Residents who are interested in birds are  encouraged to attend the annual Birdathon/Bandathon held at Riveredge Nature Center and sponsored by the Noel J. Cutright Bird Club. The event, which usually tallies 100+ bird species, runs from 8 a.m. to noon at Riveredge and involves bird banding and group bird hikes.

<p>A trail of roughly 25 bluebird boxes is also monitored weekly from April to September at the RNC. The purpose of the trail is to increase the production of bluebirds and other cavity-nesting birds on the property.

Its purpose is to determine breeding bird densities along Riveredge Creek four times during June and July. Newburg &amp; RNC are also located within one of the <a href="http://ebird.org/content/atlaswi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WI Breeding Bird Atlas II</a> priority blocks. Comprehensive Atlasing field surveys have documented the distribution and abundance of birds breeding in an area. This information will allow us to see changes in populations since the last survey five years ago and to measure future changes. These insights will help identify conservation needs of breeding birds and help us to try to meet those needs.</p>

From dawn ‘til dusk teams of birders count winter birds in the field or at their feeders within a 15 mile diameter circle around Newburg.
