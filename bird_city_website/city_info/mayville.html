The city worked with the Friends group, among others, in the past to design and print a “Tour de Marsh” bike, hike and auto tour map. A kick off of the opening of the new trails and of the map took place in 2011. The event was such a success that it has become an annual event with the kick-off of the opening of the trails being the first Saturday in June.  There are free concessions along the routes, contests and birding and other information at the stops. The City of Mayville and the Mayville Area Chamber of Commerce have also made monetary contributions to the Education Center and many of the volunteers there are from Mayville. The Horicon Marsh is not only a Wetland of International Importance but is also part of the Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail.</p>

The festival focuses on introducing visitors to many birds at the peak of spring migration. Many birding events take place during the festival including bird hikes, boat tours into the marsh for birding, nest box monitoring, bird banding and much more. This festival was established as a celebration of the fall migration. Over the 30 years they have included birding information to those in attendance, marsh bus tours, bird identification contests and exhibits from Wings Over Wisconsin and the DNR. In 2012, the route of the bicycle tour was redone in order to include more of the marsh and birding on the routes.</p></p>
