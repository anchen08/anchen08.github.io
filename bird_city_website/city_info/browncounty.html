<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The Brown County Comprehensive Plan, rewritten in 2004, and updated in 2007, was designed to meet the criteria of ”Smart Growth” planning in the state of Wisconsin. The plan includes many sections and chapters related to wildlife habitat protection and restoration. The most significant section is Chapter 8, titled “Natural and Cultural Resources.”  This chapter of the comprehensive plan includes an inventory and analysis of shoreland corridors, wetlands, environmentally sensitive areas, woodlands, wildlife habitat, endangered species (including birds), etc. in order to allow the <em>“…facilitation of the movement of wildlife and provision of game and non-game wildlife.”</em>  Recommendations from the chapter include encouraging local units of government in their effort to the “Tree City USA” program, urban forestry efforts, and to identify and protect significant natural resource features. Such encouragement was the driving force behind performing a bird study with the Town of Ledgeview as part of the Town’s Park and Recreation Plan amongst other projects.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>See 1C above.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p> The southern edge of Green Bay once contained one of the largest and most diverse wetland habitat complexes in the Great Lakes. These wetlands had historically been protected from high energy wave and storm actions by the Cat Island chain of barrier islands. The west shore of Green Bay also provides a "leading line" that guides and concentrates migrating birds from a broad northern opening to the southern tip of the bay. Shallow waters and extensive beds of submergent and emergent aquatic vegetation provide a major stopover for waterfowl and other migrating birds; as well as habitat for diverse populations of water birds, furbearers, invertebrates, and native fishes. According to USFWS surveys conducted in the 1990s, the Cat Islands provided nesting habitat for 13 species of colonial nesting water birds, the highest species diversity of any island in the Great Lakes. During extremely high water levels in the mid-1970s, a series of severe storms during ice breakup resulted in catastrophic erosion and ice damage to the islands. While remnant islands and wetland habitat still remained, most of this habitat was lost or degraded due to erosion negatively affecting both habitat and water quality.</p>
<p>In 1988, as part of the development of the Lower Green Bay Remedial Action Plan, the restoration of the Cat Island chain was identified as the top priority for restoration of habitat in Green Bay. In 2005 Brown County as the Port of Green Bay received a Lake Bed Grant (2005 Wisconsin Act 390) from the Wisconsin Legislature to allow for reconstruction of the Cat Island Chain in Green Bay.</p>
<p>In addition to the environmental benefits, the islands provide the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Port of Green Bay a safe and beneficial place to deposit clean navigational sediments. Maintenance dredging of the Green Bay Harbor is the foundation of the economic vitality of the Port of Green Bay. A backlog of dredged material exists in the navigational channel in excess of one million cubic yards. The three islands are anticipated to provide disposal capacity of 20-30 years for clean dredged material from the outer harbor in Green Bay.</p>
<p>The primary goals of the Cat Island Chain Restoration Project are to:</p>
<p>• Reestablish the historic string of barrier islands and shoals to protect remaining wetland habitat, promote reestablishment of additional emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation and restore island habitat; and</p>
<p>• Provide disposal capacity for clean dredged material from the outer harbor in Green Bay navigational channel, beneficially reusing the dredge material.</p>
<p>In 2012, after nearly 25 years of planning and searching for funding, the Brown County Port &amp; Resource Recovery Department began reconstruction of the first portion of the Cat Island chain through funding provided by a $1.5 million EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Grant. Brown County completed the initial phase of the project through construction of a wave barrier extending 3,900 feet into the bay. Additional phases were funded through a cooperative effort between Brown County and the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The remainder of the 2.5 mile wave barrier as well as the side dikes for the three islands were constructed by the Corps from 2012 to 2014 as was an offloading facility at the shipping channel. The chain has been designed as three open-backed islands with a connecting dike that serves as a wave barrier. The islands will be filled over the next 20-33 years by the Corps of Engineers using clean dredge material from the maintenance of the Green Bay Harbor.</p>
<p>The project will reconstruct the Cat Islands protecting and restoring approximately 1,225 acres of shallow water and wetland habitat with construction of the wave barrier along the remnant Cat Island shoals. The wave barrier provides the base for filling the three islands with beneficially reused material dredged from the outer navigation channel. The islands total about 272 acres and are helping to recreate island habitat and, by blocking wave energy reestablishing aquatic plant beds in the lower bay. Restoring the islands is expected to lead to recovery of much of the important lower bay habitat and benefit sport and commercial fisheries, colonial nesting water birds, shorebirds, waterfowl, marsh nesting birds, amphibians, turtles, invertebrates, and fur-bearing mammals. The wave barrier will provide long-term protection to the barrier islands and restored wetlands from future storm and ice damage.</p>
<p>While originally estimated at $35 million to complete the project, the final cost was just under $20 million with Port of Green Bay through the Brown County Port &amp; Resource Recovery Department providing 35% or about $6 million as a match for the construction phases that were completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The project is a partnership between the Port of Green Bay, Brown County, US Army Corps of Engineers, US Environmental Protection Agency, US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Wisconsin Departments of Transportation and Natural Resources, Lower Fox River/Green Bay Natural Resources Trustee Council, UW Sea-Grant, UW-Green Bay and 14 Port terminal operators. Funding was provided from EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative grants, a Wisconsin DOT Harbor Assistance Program grant, a Natural Resources Damages Assessment grant, and funds collected by the Port of Green Bay.</p>
<p>Oversight for the project and future management decisions are provided by the Cat Island Advisory Committee (CIAC) which was established by the WDNR as part of the Water Quality Permit for the project. The permit establishes the CIAC as a five-member committee with one representative each from the WDNR, Port of Green Bay, Corps, USFWS and a citizen member. In addition advisory members from UW-Green Bay, UW Sea Grant and other organizations provide input to the committee on a variety of issues dealing with management of the islands.</p>
<p>The impact of the Cat Island Chain restoration has already been seen in improved water quality, re-vegetation of near shore areas and an increase in waterfowl species. The project is also seen as a model for beneficial reuse of dredge material. We expect to see impacts well into the future.</p>

(Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>Wisconsin State statutory protection for waterfowl areas includes the 1,000 acre Barkhausen Waterfowl Refuge and further protections are listed in the following ordinances.</p>
<p>The Brown County Park and Outdoor Recreation Plan, rewritten in 2008, provides a planning document that promotes the stewardship of natural, historical and cultural resources throughout Brown County. The plan addresses the needs of birds and other wildlife by seeking to <em>“maintain wildlife corridors to adequate linkage for wildlife movement and about wildlife areas…,” </em>and by verifying that recreational areas <em>“…do not adversely affect the preservation and protection of wildlife habitat areas.”</em>  The park plan also seeks to protect natural resources through wildlife management, protection of forestlands, maintenance of wildlife population levels, encouragement of native biological diversity, promotion of stewardship projects, providing for sustainable development, discouraging private development that encroaches upon nature, making natural areas accessible without destroying natural features and habitat while controlling minimal access in passive areas. This is all done in an effort to protect, retain, and regain natural habitat for plant and animal species, including birds.</p>
<p>The Brown County Sewage Plan, rewritten in 2002, allows Brown County to operate as an agent of the WDNR for sewer service areas and environmentally sensitive area protection and amendments. When sites are reviewed using the Sewage Plan, one major component that must always be addressed is the <em>“protection and provision of wildlife habitat.”</em> This includes habitat for bird species, with a focus on areas associated with environmentally sensitive area features such as rivers, ponds, lakes, wetlands, and steep slopes. Amendments may not be approved without proof that habitat is not disrupted, unless a restoration or mitigation plan is submitted and approved by Brown County staff, the Brown County Planning Commission Board of Directors, and the WDNR Bureau of Watershed Management. The Brown County Sewage Plan also encourages that the development of shorelands meet standards set forth in NR 115, Brown County Chapter 22 related to shorelands and wetlands and Chapter 23 related to floodplains.</p>
<p>The Brown County Subdivisions Ordinance, rewritten 2002 and updated in 2009, replicates the requirements of the Brown County Sewage Plan related to the protection of environmentally sensitive areas. The Subdivisions Ordinance requires that all environmentally sensitive areas, and buffer areas adjacent to such features, be properly shown on plats and certified survey areas before the documents can be recorded. This helps property owners and developers identify lands that should be protected due to its importance for wildlife habitat and water quality, including habitat for waterfowl and other bird species. In 2010, Brown County PALS staff began working with staff specialized in planning, zoning and property listing in order to adapt environmentally sensitive areas into a format that replicates the Sewage Plan, Subdivisions Ordinance, Shorelands and Wetlands Ordinance. The proposal is in draft form but has been reviewed by a subcommittee developing the Subdivision’s Ordinance rewrite, and has been reviewed by the WDNR Bureau of Watershed Management.</p>
<p>The Brown County Shorelands and Wetlands ordinance does not include elements to protect environmentally sensitive areas. However, in 2010-2011, the ordinance has been undergoing a rewrite to include enforcement and references related to the protection of wildlife habitat as identified in the Brown County Sewage Plan, Subdivisions Ordinance, and NR 115. A proposed ordinance potentially will include statements such as, <em>“Environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) are portions of the landscape, including valuable natural resource features that should be protected from intensive development. ESAs shall include all lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, floodways, and certain other significant and unique natural resource features. Furthermore, areas of steep slopes (slopes 12% or greater) when located wholly or partially within these natural resource features shall also be included as an ESA.”</em>  The proposed ordinance also establishes specific <em>“…impervious surface standards to protect water quality and fish and wildlife…,”</em> may impact lands within 300 feet of a stream, and establishes shoreland setbacks. The ordinance also establishes mitigation plan requirements for shoreline buffer restoration and enhancement plans.</p>
<p>The Control of Construction Site Erosion Resulting from Land Disturbing Activities and the Control of Post Construction Storm Water Management ordinances provide construction site erosion control standards and reduce the amount of post-construction storm water pollutants that could affect wildlife habitat and waters of the state, including bird habitat. The standards meet and exceed standards of NR 115. The ordinance affects Brown County highways within the urbanized areas of Brown County.</p>
<p>The Brown County MS4 Permit Storm Water Ordinance, written in 2009, is an adaption of storm water ordinances written in the Subdivisions Ordinance. The MS4 Ordinance addresses illicit discharges on county highway systems within the urbanized area. The affected area includes roadside ditches, swales, and ultimately rivers connecting to waters of the state. Ditches and rivers serve as habitat for wildlife, including birds. The MS4 Storm Water Ordinance provides information regarding swale connections and an efficient response procedure that minimizes the damages to bird habitat and water habitat that could occur if a spill was not addressed. All county highway systems and related outfalls that are potential illicit discharge sites have been located using GPS system and mapped using a GIS program. Likewise, all sites are field visited at least once every five years to verify damage to habitat has not occurred.</p>
<p>In 2013, a two-year partnership project began to address the infrastructure needs associated with the 33 acre couth wetland impoundment of the Barkhausen Waterfowl Preserve. In addition, a 56 acre tract of the north end of the preserve is targeted for aggressive invasive woody plant species. Both of these projects will aid in both the creation of habitat and removing hazards to birds.</p>
