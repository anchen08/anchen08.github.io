<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>On November 3, 2009, the Village of Osceola adopted the <em>Village of Osceola Comprehensive Plan 2009-2029</em>. This plan was further updated in 2019 to reflect new completions and limited goals. The Village also partnered with the creation of a region/local housing study designed to promote smart housing options including higher density, low impact developments.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The Village's Comprehensive Plan and ongoing parks plan includes the promotion of green space. While not officially designated as bird habitat, the Village promotes the removal of invasive species (buckthorn) and the replacement of native species. An example is the ongoing removal of buckthorn and reed canary grass along our waterways.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The local Chamber of Commerce and MainStreet Director Germaine Ross has 21 years of experience as a landscape designer specializing in sustainable landscaping that promotes bird friendly habitats. She has been the Chair of the Grow Osceola Design Committee (a WI MainStreet approach committee) for 11 years and along with her current role as director remains active in guiding the group as well as an active member of the Rivertown Trails Coalition. Ms. Ross pledges to continue to integrate her expertise and commitment to make Osceola a bird-friendly village.</p></p>

<h4>Community Forest Management</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Osceola continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 2008. With every installation of new planting areas, the Village considers adding bird-friendly habitat. For example, the new Trailhead located within the Village that was recently planted in October 2016 included mostly bird-friendly plants and designed to attract more birds to the area. Several rain gardens have been planted with bird-friendly designs and are effective in attracting migratory birds and many more song birds into the Village. The Village has maintained parks and nature areas that continue to have new trees planted and maintained. in 2020, supporters developed a new trail head adjacent to a large passive park. All species were bird friendly and included benches, bicycle accommodations and an improved sign. in 2021, the Village is transplanting over 60 recently planted native conifers that will be placed in Village parks.</p>

<h4>Limiting or Removing Threats to Birds</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection. (Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>The land behind the Osceola Public Library, along Mill Pond Park and Osceola Creek is protected and favorable for bird habitat for multiple reasons. First of all, part of this land was bought by the DNR and is protected as a flood plain. One of the stipulations is that buildings cannot be erected upon it. Secondly, the Polk County Land and Water Resources Department partnered with St. Croix Valley Landscaping in planting native prairie grasses, shrubs, trees and forbs that naturally support bird habitat. Attached documentation to this application shows the land’s protection as a flood plain and that it is maintained with best management practices (BMPs). There are many benefits for birds related to using BMPs. The native vegetation provides food, water, and shelter (i.e. berries and seeds, invertebrates, structure, etc.). Native vegetation also provides habitat and food for fish, reduces sedimentation and protects spawning areas, and provides small microclimates via shading. Therefore, by planting native grasses, using BMPs, and having its protection as a flood plain, this land is protected as bird habitat.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.standingcedars.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Standing Cedars Land Conservancy</a> is located just a few minutes south of Osceola is 1,500 acres that includes some of the highest-quality natural areas along the St. Croix River. Standing Cedars uses various tools to protect land from development, is open to the public, with trails in forests, fields, and bluff lands along the Lower St. Croix River. These beautiful natural areas have trails and vast acres of restored prairie (great bird habitat) that you can experience three ecosystems converging: Northern Boreal Forest, Eastern Hardwood, and Tall Grass Prairie. It is protected land for bird habitat. </p>
<p>The Village is also actively promoting smart development practices such as wildlife sensitive storm basins designed to protect species. Also, the Village requires review of developments from a wildlife impact point of view. An example of this is eagle nests within proximity to mining and commercial developments near the St. Croix River.</p>

Grow Osceola creates and maintains hiking trails, manages buckthorn, cares for parks, seasonal plantings, and encourages the use of trails, flowers, and trees, all of which help conserve bird habitat and make Osceola more bird friendly. A new trail called the Falls Bluff Loop Trail was built in 2016 that includes the Falls, St. Croix River, views from the bluffs of the river valley, and a natural spring (all great diversity for a variety of birds.) Along with the St. Croix River Association, Osceola is planning and has funding available for new interpretive signage that includes education about birds along at least three trails in Osceola. The Village is in the process of identifying viewing areas and having new benches built by the Osceola Boy Scout troops for the Falls Bluff Trail.</p>
<p>Standing Cedars Land Conservancy is located adjacent to the Village of Osceola and includes 1,500 acres open to the public, with trails in forests, fields, wetlands and bluff lands along the Lower St. Croix River. They also have a new property within the Village boundaries. These beautiful natural areas with vast restored prairies have trails that you can experience three ecosystems converging: Northern Boreal Forest, Eastern Hardwood, and Tall Grass Prairie. Every spring bird walks are conducted on a variety of these trails. This is an ongoing promotion.</p></p>
