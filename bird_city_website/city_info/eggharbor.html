<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The community of Egg Harbor believes good stewardship of the land and waters is vital to their long-term success, and that includes supporting migrating and non-migrating wildlife. The Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Village in 2019 is evidence of this claim and is also in compliance with Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” law for land use planning and resource management. Furthermore, there has been tremendous interest and support, both in the private and public sectors, that Bird City status will be a means of conveying to a wider audience their understanding of the role of local government in matters concerning the natural and modified environment.</p>
<p>The Village of Egg Harbor has worked very hard to develop and make natural resources stewardship a part of our community's culture. In 2006 under the leadership of the village board, the Village of Egg Harbor began its effort to become better stewards of the waters and lands by prohibiting the use of phosphorus in fertilizers applied to municipally owned properties and by prohibiting the sale of phosphorous fertilizers in the Village. This stewardship effort continued on with surface water quality improvement projects such as our 2009 initiatives to improve the surface waters by installing permeable pavers and bio filters at the Egg Harbor Beach and Marina.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of Egg Harbor has reestablished our Bird City Ad-Hoc Committee in order create additional bird habitat as well as tackle the task of removing invasive species. The Bird City Ad-Hoc committee consists of five members including one Village Trustee to act as committee chair and four citizen members, one of which was a member of our original Bird City Ad-Hoc Committee. The Village of Egg Harbor completed the Bay View Memorial Terrace project in 2018 which is conveniently located near Bird View Park. The project featured terraced plantings one specifically planted with bird and butterfly friendly plants.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Egg Harbor continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 2013.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community.

(Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>While the Village of Egg Harbor does not have vast tracts of public wild land, there are several areas that are very close by and in the corporate limits. The White Cliff Nature Preserve (WCNP), which is part of the Door County Land Trust, is located near downtown Egg Harbor and contains a portion of the Niagara Escarpment. The preserve features mature forest stands of maple, beech, hemlock and white cedar with a diverse understory including spring ephemeral wildflowers on its 103 protected acres. Also in the WCNP is a 30-acre fen that is the centerpiece of its complex wetland system that provides wonderful habitat for local and visiting birds.</p>
<p>Surrounded by orchards, Village View Park is a wide open grass field with several edges that border wood lot and transition zone brush. Village View Park offers casual visitors a chance to see one of Wisconsin's wonders, the Eastern Bluebird. In 2009, a local bluebird enthusiast approached the Village asking for permission to place several nesting boxes on the property, the Village without hesitation said "yes"!</p>
<p>The Egg Harbor Marina, while seeming unfriendly to birds given its very busy nature and hardscapes, is a great accessible place to see migrating waterfowl and birds of all feathers. The marina and the break wall is a common place to observe gathering Brown Pelicans.</p>
<p>While natural places for birds are great and necessary, it is hard to explain to people why they should spend public dollars on their preservation if the wild places are inaccessible. Bird View Park, formerly known as Nature Park, was just one of those spaces. Undeveloped with no access other than being able to walk by on a county and Village road, Bird View Park was inaccessible. In 2008, the Village of Egg Harbor constructed, on a former road grade, an accessible trail that brings people off the pavement and into the forest canopy.  In 2017, the Village of Egg Harbor's skilled Public Works crew added duck boxes to Bird View Park that were placed off of the public trail as not to disturb the wildlife.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

They maintain and improve parks, beaches, and natural landscapes by encouraging protection of trees and by planting native plants. The Village of Egg Harbor does not restrict wild or natural lawns and landscaping and is evident by the lack of regulation in their nuisance ordinance.</p><br><br><strong>1.4.1, Show that your community offers the public information on how they can control and remove invasive species in order to improve or maintain bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>In 2019, the Village of Egg Harbor officially started a new invasive species removal campaign by hiring an Environmental and Sustainability Coordinator to put together an invasive species removal program.  The ultimate goal of the Village of Egg Harbor Invasive Species program is to create a comprehensive map of invasive species on public and private property and document the growth and eradication. The Village will be working diligently to educate and communicate with all property owners on invasive species control and removal.

The ordinances highlight proper tree care and removal and also when it is prohibited or permitted.</p></p>
