This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>Door County provides strong and ample zoning ordinances designating legal protection of birds and their ancillary habitat.  Zoning Chapter 2 “Zoning Districts; Use Regulations 2.01” specifically lists those protections under Wetlands, Natural Areas, Chambers Island, and Conservation Areas.  Other zones such as Countryside, Heartland, Estate, and Rural Residential all promote large, rural expanses of vegetative land and diminished building densities.  Zoning Chapter 5 “Natural Features Protection Requirements” further emphasizes that all zoning districts “preserve the natural beauty of Door County, and protect wild flora and fauna.”  Zoning Chapter 6 “Conservation Subdivision” states that “The conservation subdivision option is intended to preserve natural resources.”  Chapter 12 of Parks and Recreation prohibits the destruction of park natural resources (12.01) and the protection of wildlife (12.03)</p>
<p>County parks, such as Robert LaSalle and Forestville Dam have established and demarcated “prairie” plantings promoting bird habitat.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Door County has numerous ecological organizations with the mission to preserve and enhance the ecological communities within Door County. Part of these government, and non-profit efforts aim to provide additional bird habitat by active land acquisition and through installation of conservation easement. An example is the Door County Land Trust actively seeks to purchase property to preserve in perpetuity to preserve the ecological integrity of the site. One of the consideration factors when the Door County Land Trust seeks to protect land is migratory and residential bird use. Additionally, US Fish and Wildlife’s Partner program aims to install conservation land practices “to benefit federal trust species including migratory birds, endangered, threatened and at-risk species” (more info please visit https://www.fws.gov/program/partners-fish-and-wildlife).</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Destination Door County’s website (https://www.doorcounty.com/experience/birding) has a Birding Maps section that conveniently shows 33 different mapped areas each denoting specific look out spots to view birds along with a direct link to Bird City Wisconsin website.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Sturgeon Bay continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1994.  In 2015 the City also earned the Tree Growth Award for the first time.  Ephraim recently joined in 2021.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong></strong></p><p>Door County Parks was awarded a County Conservation Aids grant (2018-2019) to restore 3 acres of grass into pollinator &amp; bird-friendly prairie plantings.  Its first growing season was in 2020 and it is currently established with a thriving habitat for birds.  The project is creating connectivity through Southern Door County and along vital migratory bird migration routes along Lake Michigan.  More prairie plantings totaling 3 acres at various county parks are being planned for 2023.</p>
<p>In 2022 Door County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Department secured a pollinator planting through funding from US Fish and Wildlife and the Natural Resources Foundation of Wisconsin. This pollinator planter is available to all members of the public to help install prairie plantings. Additionally, Door County Soil &amp; Water became a seed partner with Pheasants Forever to help elevate costs with acquiring pollinator seeds. These efforts allowed Door County to install approximately 30 acres of pollinator habitat on private land through this effort.</p>
