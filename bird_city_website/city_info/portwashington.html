<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Port Washington has adopted and is in compliance with Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” law concerning land use planning and natural resources. Their Comprehensive Plan is in effect until 2035.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p> </p>
<p>City leadership and staff and the City Environmental Planning Committee are currently leading forward ecological restoration work on a largely undefined 27-acre City park space known as "Birchwood Hills." They have sought partnership opportunities with Wisconsin Wetlands Association and Ducks Unlimited to advance the work, which is now underway! Public trails, educational and birding opportunities, invasive species removal, and new planting will be part of this overall community effort.</p>
<p>Coal Dock Park is our City’s newest park. It is adjacent to the picturesque downtown and marina. The Park has a 1,500’ promenade and an 80’ pedestrian bridge that provide access to Lake Michigan, the South Dock (bird sanctuary) and to the South Beach. It also features scenic views, festivals, a walking path, benches, green space and an occasional visiting ship. Plans are in place to continue to enhance this park to include additional native plantings that will support resident and migrating birds.</p>
<p>We Energies established a wetland and upland buffer on the old south coal dock for the Port Washington Generating Station as a Migratory Bird Stopover. It was constructed as part of mitigation project associated with USACE permits for work that occurred related to the power plant. The mitigation requires the created habitat be maintained as such in perpetuity. We Energies will be working with the City and others to enhance this area to provide better habitat.</p>
<p>Our City Park and Open Space Plan specifically recommends preserving the high quality lands for protection of vegetation, drainage and wildlife resources. Several objectives associated with this recommendation call for habitat restoration and environmental corridor preservation. The plan also calls for potential future acquisition of lands, which was the impetus for the City taking the lead on the <em>Cedar Vineyards</em> development and advancing the central tenet of protection of the most environmentally sensitive land, including along the Migratory Bird corridor.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The Ozaukee Washington Land Trust and Ozaukee County are actively working to protect two key natural areas within the City of Port Washington. The sites are the Port Washington Clay Bluffs and the Cedar Heights Gorge. Both sites are on the shores of Lake Michigan and serve as important habitat for resident birds and stopover habitat for migratory birds.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Port Washington continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1995.

<p>In 2017, Mayor Mlada and our City of Port Washington Environmental Planning Committee (EPC) led forward City participation in the "Mayor's Monarch Pledge" Program. This is a national initiative aimed at generating awareness of, engagement in, and advocacy for the plight of the Monarch butterfly. The City was a very active participant in year one, including efforts to educate the public (presentation during Ecopalooza at Thomas Jefferson Middle School as part of our EPC's "Earth Week" Activities.

Using nationally-celebrated “Earth Day” as our springboard, we have worked with junior high school leadership and instructional staff to integrate sustainability-related activities each day of the week. We believe this provides a far greater impact than a single day of activities. Over the past two years, our “Earth Week” celebration has included a Community Clean-Up Day (including of our beaches and various parks, with garbage, invasive species, and other issues of focus); a Community Tree-Planting Day; a “Mayor’s Monarch Pledge” Day with focus on planting and protection of Monarch habitat; a Celebration of the Arts in the Environment Day (with one year focused on rain barrels and the next year focused on stenciling of storm water drains); and “Eco-Palooza,” a three-hour “smorgasbord” of environmental themes, highlighted at numerous stations around the gym at which the students rotate and spend about 20 minutes. Bird (and other wildlife) protection and education themes have been incorporated into “Eco-Palooza” stations, with our partners from Riveredge and the Wisconsin Humane Society presenting to the students.
