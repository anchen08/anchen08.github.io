There is a total of 1,188 acres of green space in the City of Mequon (this number includes Mequon Nature Preserve's 510 acres).</p>
<p>Newly-developing habitats at the Mequon Nature Preserve are attracting wildlife species. In 2022 MNP began the restoration of 52 acres of agricultural land by breaking drain tile. This brings the total acreage in active habitat restoration to 374, up from only 22 acres of woodlot in 2004. In Winter of 2021, the City of Mequon and MNP received an aditional 66 acres of restored land from MMSD. This acerage adds to the footprint of MNP bringing the total acreage to 510. In 2022, MNP further restored a 40-acre project parcel by seeding five different high-diversity, native seed mixes and planting over 1500 native trees and shrubs in a former farm field. The variety and proximity of these habitats promise to bring more birds to the site and offer more space and opportunities for breeding sites.</p>
<p>MNP planted a combination of 3,000 native-species tree and shrub seedlings in 2022, as well as 1,500 container trees and shrubs. The City of Mequon also hands out hundreds of native tree seedlings annually at its Arbor Day/World Migratory Bird Day celebration to any interested resident further incorperating native species into the community.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>In 2016 a consortium of nonprofits, government agencies and concerned citizens, called the Mequon Preservation Partners, began meeting together to plan protecting more green space in the Mequon area. The group's stated goal is to educate the public about creating/saving habitat and protecting water resources. In 2022, The Sunrise Rotary Club of Mequon/Theinsville planted an educational pollinator garden in Rotary Park. Educational signage was installed for the public to learn about the benefits of pollinators and native habitats. The Rotary CLub also supports Operation Pollination which is a nationwide movement to encourage adding native plants to landscaping.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Mequon continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1994.
