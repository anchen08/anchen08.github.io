<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of Brown Deer has completed and published a comprehensive plan, entitled “Village of Brown Deer Comprehensive Plan 2030.” This document serves as a guide for future Village land use decisions and contains the nine required elements of the state of Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” law. An update to the Comprehensive Plan is currently underway and scheduled to be adopted in May 2023.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The second chapter of the Village of Brown Deer’s Comprehensive Plan specifically addresses the need to identify, protect, and enhance the Village’s natural resources and habitats. It describes the relative scarcity of habitats due to decades of development, and the need to protect those that remain. The chapter also includes a listing of natural resource goals and specific objectives to satisfy those goals. Objective 1.5 identifies the need to promote an increase in the urban tree canopy and Village street tree population. Later in the chapter, the Village delineates recommendations for natural resources and specifically identifies the need to promote natural area restoration. This includes measures to connect isolated natural areas wherever possible and to work with private landowners to control or eradicate invasive species encroaching upon those natural habitats.</p>
<p>The Village also developed a Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (CORP) that includes specific recommendations protecting avian habitats. The Department of Natural Resources approved this plan in January 2016, qualifying the Village to apply for state and federal aids to improve green spaces and open space programming. Chapter 7 of this document is dedicated to the goals and objectives identified by the community to improve natural areas and public recreation resources. Goal #9 calls on the Village to <em>“protect, enhance, and restore natural environments and historic and cultural resources associated with Village parks, playfields, trails, and open spaces.”</em> Each goal is accompanied by “supporting objectives.” Goal #9’s “Supporting Objectives” are listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restore, protect, and enhance Natural Areas (this includes wetlands, woodlands, and grasslands).</li>
<li>Protect riparian lands along waterways.</li>
<li>Manage invasive species.</li>
<li>Identify, protect, and enhance natural habitats for native plant and animal species identified in the Comprehensive Plan (Table 2.1) as endangered or rare in Milwaukee County.</li>
</ul><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of Brown Deer continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1997 and looks forward to continuing their dedication to forest management.</p></p>

<h4>Limiting or Removing Threats to Birds</h4>
<p></p>

(Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>In 2019 the Village naturalized another section of Beaver Creek a tributary of the Milwaukee River. As a part of this naturalization the concrete lining of the channel was removed and replaced with native vegetation that will provide habitat for birds and other wlidlife.  This effort is the third such naturalization effort along Beaver Creek bringing our total lineal distance over 1 mile of newly naturalized habitat. Another stream bank stabilization project is scheduled for 2023 along Beaver Creek.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong></strong></p><p>The Village has naturalized three sections (to date) of Beaver Creek a tributary of the Milwaukee River. These sections were previously concrete lined and heavily eroded with some intrusion of invasive species. The Village restored the natural flow and meander of the waterway while removing concrete and invasives and replacing with native vegetation. Similar efforts were conducted along two drainage easements that led to Beaver Creek and Southbranch Creek respectively. Finally, the Village recently reconstructed W. Bradley Road and created a new green bioswale median that captures stormwater runoff before going into the storm sewer system. The bioswales are planted with native vegetation to help absorb pollutants and excess water and replace one concrete travel lane. In 2022, the new Village librabry parking was redone with biolswales, pervious pavement and planted with native vegetation.</p></p>

Badger Meter River Park, preserved the river bank and associated native vegetation while making it publicly accessible . The park also has been landscaped with indigenous wildflowers and tree species that provide habitat for birds, whereas before the land was dirt and gravel covered often used a staging ground for DOT construction projects. The Village is seeking to partner with the YMCA and Audubon Society to open access to 60 plus acres of adjacent land which will be preserved and restored and provide for hiking and birding opportunities. A new one acre park along the Oak Leaf Trail is currently in final planning stages.
