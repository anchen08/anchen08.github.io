<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>Mercer adopted the <em>Town of Mercer Comprehensive Plan 2025</em> in 2005. The plan is in compliance with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. See attachment of the plan sections 5 and 8.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Park planning in the Town of Mercer has been highlighted in the community’s “Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan,” which was adopted in 2006 and amended three times, most recently in 2010.</p>
<p>In Section 5, the document notes the ongoing planning process. Section 6 describes the planning region with a detailed focus on the Town of Mercer’s important water resources around which a number of wildlife viewing accesses have been formulated. These accesses are available on and around local lakes and on the 27,000 acres on the Turtle-Flambeau Flowage and the Little Turtle Flowage. Nearly 54% of Mercer is public land that supports both motorized and non-motorized recreation. The wildlife and natural habitat are vital to the community’s outdoor recreation planning. The outdoor plan’s latest Statement of Need describes a great necessity to link its rich nature-based attributes with a 7-mile non-motorized trail that extends to Vilas County and serves as the northern-most link in the Heart of Vilas County Trail System. The trail provides access to the area’s unique wildlife and natural habitat.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community.

We are hosting free guided tours throughout Mercer in Iron County, WI. At previous events, for the bird enthusiasts we had bird watching tours led by naturalists Zach Wilson and John Bates. Bird banding demonstrations were conducted by Bruce Bacon and Zach Wilson.  A Bald Eagle (chicks) banding trip was led by Bruce Bacon and climber Jeff Hays from Ohio. There were free bird house kits for kids ready to put together by the kids and volunteers from the Northwoods Wildlife and Wetlands Club. A bird house display showed participants other house design options. Wild Instincts (wildlife rehabbers) from Rhinelander brought several educational birds for people to see and answered questions. Iron County Conservation Department had a display on invasive species.  A bird calling contest showed the skills of 5 callers and was judged by Zach Wilson. This year, Bruce Bacon and John Bates will be taking indivduals on the guided hikes in the Turtle Flambeau Scenic waters and hiking trails to bird watch and bird band on a couple different dates in the end of may- the main tours will occur on May 24th. </p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane44"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_44"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_44"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_delimiter cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_247"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_247" id="cblabcbfv_247"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong></strong></p><p>The Mercer area has numerous web links and local clubs that both provide information and actively participate in creating and enhancing backyard bird habitat.

This area encompasses a wide variety of wildlife habitats, including large expanses of open water, hundreds of scattered islands and many quiet bays. Surrounding woodlands vary from steeply rolling hills to level terrain with grassy openings, small wild lakes and ponds, and expansive wetlands. The woodlands consist of Aspen, northern hardwoods, White Birch, pine and scattered old growth Hemlock pockets.</p>
<p>The Flowage, known for its high density of Bald Eagles, Ospreys and Common Loons, also hosts Black Terns, Merlins, Trumpeter Swans and over 150 other bird species. In addition, a variety of reptiles, amphibians and mammals including deer, bear, bobcat and timber wolves also reside there. Even the occasional moose hangs out there in the fall. Many opportunities exist to observe and enjoy wildlife in a remote and wild setting.</p>
<p>Also located a short distance to the north of Mercer is the Underwood State Wildlife Area. This is a 1,600-acre upland forest and cedar swamp, home to Bald Eagles and Ruffed Grouse.</p></p>

<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>3.6.1, Demonstrate that your community is represented in at least one citizen science bird-monitoring program (e.g., the Christmas Bird Count, Great Backyard Bird Count, Swift Night Out)</strong></strong></p><p>Tens of thousands of volunteers throughout the Americas take part in an adventure that has become a family tradition for years. Families and students, birders and scientists, armed with binoculars, bird guides and checklists go out on an annual mission: The Christmas Bird Count. For more than 100 years, the desire to both make a difference and to experience the beauty of nature has driven dedicated people all around the world to leave the comfort of a warm house during the holidays and venture into the woods, fields, and bank parking lots in search of birds.. Audubon and other organizations use data collected in this longest-running wildlife census to assess the health of bird populations - and to help guide conservation action. Both the Town of Mercer and the Town of Manitowish Waters fall within a count circle that has been organized for over 20 years by naturalist and artist John Bates and Mary Burns.</p>
<p>In addition, Town of Mercer residents participate in the Annual Sandhill Crane Count in Iron County. The count is conducted every spring as a population survey throughout the state. Data are collected and sent to the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, WI.</p><br><br><strong>3.6.2, Attach results from organized bird monitoring or data obtained from researchers or volunteers in the local park system. (Exclusions: programs that receive credit under 4C: Christmas Bird Count, Great Backyard Bird Count, Swift Night Out)</strong></strong></p><p>Priding themselves as the “Loon Capital of the World,” it is unsurprising that Mercer has been actively involved in Iron County’s citizen-based loon monitoring project for over 16 years, resulting in many successfully hatched loon chicks from artificial platforms. In 1999, the WDNR approached a group of Environmental Educators in Iron County with the idea of piloting a citizen-monitoring program for artificial loon nesting platforms. The concept for the Practicum in Loon and Lake Ecology came out of this discussion, with Hurley and Mercer students involved in a pilot during the spring and summer of 2000. Students constructed nesting platforms; selected study lakes based on water quality and habitat features, and placed and monitored the platforms in spring and summer. As of 2018, this program has been monitoring lake health and loon production for 18 years in the Mercer and Hurley Area. The students’ work has resulted in many successfully hatched loon chicks from the artificial platforms that they have constructed and placed out for loons to use in Iron County.</p>
<p>Rice Lake and the Flambeau Flowage are ideal nesting grounds for loons and the efforts of monitors and platform designers the area has been recognized as a critical habitat.
