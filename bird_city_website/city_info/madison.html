The construction and materials were donated by Wisconsin Union Trades representative Spencer Statz and other group members. The planning, implementation, celebration day, and newspaper articles were used to help educate the public and public officials about the importance of Accommodation Architecture for Swifts including leaving natural hollow trees where safe, leaving chimneys open where possible, and providing constructed Swift Towers where needed.</p><br><br><strong>1.6.2, Document the establishment of a program to promote the conservation of Purple Martins through research, state-of-the-art management techniques, or public education</strong></strong></p><p>Madison FUN (Friends of Urban Nature) partner groups including Madison Parks and Wild Warner collaborated to install a Purple Martin house with currently recommended design that is easily lowered for cleaning. The installation was done as part of the 2016 annual IMBD Bird City Celebration and it is monitored weekly along with monitoring nearby Bluebird Trails. Other insectivore Accommodation Architecture initiatives include Bat Houses at several locations and a trial of enhanced nesting surfaces under two new metal beam pedestrian and bicycle bridges in Warner Park that were then used by Barn Swallows and are being researched and monitored to determine if Cliff Swallows will use them. Also in 2016, the Friends of Cherokee Marsh installed a purple martin house in Cherokee Park and continue to provide a volunteer steward to care for the house.</p>
<p>In 2017, volunteers with the Friends of the Lakeshore Nature Preserve installed a Purple Martin house in the Biocore Prairie at UW Madison's Lakeshore Nature Preserve.  This will continue to be featured on regular hikes at the property, including the monthly Bird and Nature Outings, sponsored by Madison FUN. </p>
