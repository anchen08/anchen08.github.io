<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>1999 Wisconsin Act 9, commonly referred to as Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” legislation, stated that by January 1, 2010, any Wisconsin municipality that has programs or takes actions that affect land use must have a comprehensive plan in place. The comprehensive plan must serve as the basis for community decision-making, be consistent with the municipality’s ordinances and programs, and comply with the Wisconsin statutes as to the nine issues or elements outlined therein. In several circumstances, such as when the municipality is applying for various state funds, municipal plans will also be evaluated against general planning goals outlined in the legislation. The Smart Growth legislation has undergone various amendments since its initial enactment. Some were to clarify the legislation, others to more clearly state which municipalities were required to create comprehensive plans. The statutory requirements as to the necessary contents of a comprehensive plan have remained essentially unchanged throughout these revisions. Although the Town of Baileys Harbor was not  required to create a “Smart Growth” plan, local officials felt that it was a good idea to do so anyway, both since the existing town comprehensive plan needed to be updated and since the town might easily enact programs or ordinances that would require such a plan be in place. The Town of Baileys Harbor has therefore created and adopted this plan under the authority granted by Wisconsin Statutes Section 66.1001, replacing the town plan previously in place. Town officials hired GBH Consulting in the summer of 2002 to work with town residents on developing a new town plan that complied with the Smart Growth legislation. During the creation of the plan, eight widely publicized Public Information Meetings were held; eight newsletters were distributed to all property owners; open, posted meetings were held between GBH Consulting and the town plan commission each month; a Resource Inventory Report was completed; materials related to the plan’s development were available for review at the library and through a link on the GBH Consulting website; and volunteer citizen “work groups” drafted the initial vision statements and goals regarding each plan element.

Large portions of the town are forested or considered environmentally sensitive, and much of these portions are in permanent conservation due to ownership by The Ridges Sanctuary, The Nature Conservancy, the Door County Land Trust, University of Wisconsin, and the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Wooded areas of the Town are visible on the 2002 Aerial Photo with Wetland Overlay, which also shows areas zoned Wetland as of June 2005. The 2005 Land Use Inventory and Resources map includes two land use categories designating natural and recreational resources, and also depicts specific resources in the town such as The Ridges Sanctuary, Toft Point, the Mud Lake Wildlife Unit, and many others. Much of this coastal wetland area was internationally recognized in 2014 for its globally significant wetland communities that support over 150 species of birds that use the area for staging or nesting during spring and fall migrations.  Approximately 40-45% of the landmass in Baileys Harbor is protected in one way or another.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

Baileys Harbor as an incredible diversity of resident and migratory birds for visitors to enjoy. The Ridges has taken two major actions in the past year to increase access to natural spaces. 1. Last year The Ridges replaced and upgraded it's 800ft Range Light Boardwalk to be ADA compliant by widening the boardwalk from 4 to 6 feet, and installing toe rails for additoinal safety. This corridor is one of our most visited areas and we are proud to be a place that provides better access to a natural area in the community  2. The Ridges recently received an all-terrain Action Trackchair from a local community group that was looking to donate to the DNR but had fallen through. This Trackchair allows people with extreme disabilities to actually go on a trail.  Additionally, The Ridges hosted an "Access for All" day where people in the community were able to try the track chair at our Family Discovery Trail. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and we hope that the community can take advantage of the track chair.
