<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The Watertown is an existing apartment building developed by Samapa with 5 stories and 147 units on the former Milwaukee County Food Services site (9150 Watertown Plank Road). The building was designed with sensitivity to its location adjacent to the Sanctuary Woods (see Category 1C) by incorporating native landscaping, dark sky lighting strategies, and bird friendly details.</p>
<p>Areas in urban settings can be negatively impacted by nearby structures and other development, thereby limiting their habitat value. To address those issues, Wauwatosa’s Plan Commission required that developers of the Watertown meet with two representatives from local environmental groups to discuss the potential impacts on the habitat in the vicinity of the parcel.</p>
<p>The County Grounds Coalition, an environmental advocacy group, has taken an active role to meet with the developers to advocate for design elements to help protect wildlife. One proposal is a 20-foot buffer of evergreen trees between the development and the woods. In addition, the developers have reduced the site from 3.36 acres to 2.25 acres to respect the sanctuary Woods conservation district boundaries.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The County Grounds Coalition is also worried about light pollution, the height and density of the building, stormwater drainage and nearby birds colliding into the glass of the building and held on-going meetings with the developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The developers of the Watertown have recognized that birds navigate the built environment and the two critical areas of challenge are the glass surfaces and the light pollution. As designers they can decrease bird collision hazards by incorporating bird friendly strategies. Glazing included patterns that break down large expanses of glass. Lighting systems were designed and managed with “dark skies” in mind so that levels of light spill at night are controlled</span></p>

<p>Final Plans for this development were approved by the Wauwatosa Common Council in March 2021.  In 2022, the Watertown welcomed its first tenants.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Watertown Apartments teamed up with Ronald McDonald House Charities-Eastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee Regional Medical Center and 75 volunteers to give back to the beautiful land. They planted 140 trees across 2 acres of the Sanctuary Woods!  See attached photo Category 1H - Watertown Tree Planting.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>As of 2022, the City of Wauwatosa has been awarded Tree City USA status for 40 years, celebrated annually with a tree planting around the time of Arbor Day <a href="https://www.arborday.org/programs/treecityUSA/index.cfm#recognizedSection" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.arborday.org/programs/treecityUSA/index.cfm#recognizedSection</a></p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Wauwatosa Ordinances 9.04.070 and 9.04.080 allow honey beekeeping in residentially zoned districts within the City of Wauwatosa.

(Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>In December of 2018, the Wauwatosa Common Council approved the <a href="https://www.wauwatosa.net/home/showdocument?id=520" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Life Sciences District (LSD) Master Plan</a>. The Plan covers 1,200 acres, including 500 acres of environmental green space. This area is located east of I-41 and north of Wisconsin Avenue and includes existing developments such as Innovation Campus, the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center, and the Milwaukee County Research Park. Historically, this area has been referred to as the County Grounds. The City of Wauwatosa has zoning authority over this land.</p>
<p>Along with goals to improve traffic flow, provide housing and guide development, the LSD Plan has an additional goal to protect and enhance existing green and environmental spaces and create shared public spaces, including minimizing the impact on wildlife and bird and butterfly migration. This latter goal particularly refers to 55 acres of land commonly referred to as the Sanctuary Woods. Prior to the approval of the Plan, the Sanctuary Woods was not zoned as a Conservancy. These woods have become cherished for its habitat that attracts rare species of wildlife, including long-eared owls and flying squirrels. See attached file Category 1C - Sanctuary Woods.</p>
<p>The relevant sections of the LSD Plan that deal with environmental issues can be found in the attached file Category 1C - Life Sciences District Environment Goals. With considerable input from key public stakeholders, the following amendments were added to the Plan: </p>
<ul>
<li>Development adjacent to the parks and environmental areas to the north must be done in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as not to negatively impact the natural resources that will generate irreplaceable value to the Life Sciences District and community.</li>
<li>The City should promote and initiate a collaborative implementation process in partnership with property owners or entities and actively participate in a collaborative communication process to maintain effective communications with surrounding neighbors, landowners, and other key stakeholders.</li>
<li>The first priority should be achieving the preservation in perpetuity of the parkland and natural areas to ensure those open spaces will be the foundation of the branding and unique amenity of the Wauwatosa Life Sciences District.</li>
<li>Working to ensure that the natural features and environmental areas are preserved and protected in perpetuity through the use of land regulations, conservation easements, deed restrictions, protective covenants, and/or development agreements.</li>
<li>Requesting and considering a land divisions and a zoning map amendment from Special Purpose District – Medical Center to Special Purpose District – Conservancy for the non-park land owned by Milwaukee County to preserve and protect in perpetuity the Parks and Environmental Areas as illustrated on the Framework Plan and Proposed Future Land Use Map.</li>
</ul>
<p>In accordance with the final amendment above, in December 2019, the Wauwatosa Common Council unanimously approved Resolution R-19-196 and Ordinance O-19-30 to reflect a zoning modification to the Sanctuary Woods, making it now zoned Special Purpose Conservancy (SP-CON). This 55-acre property will now complement (and be annexed to) the 55-acre County Grounds Park, the 90-acre MMSD detention basin property and the 65-acre State Forestry Demonstration Area, creating an overall contiguous area of 500 acres of environmental green space that will provide and protect into perpetuity important wildlife habitat at the confluence of Underwood Creek and the Menomonee River.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong></strong></p><p>In December 2022, the Wauwatosa Common Council approved a No Mow May ordinance, as part of an amendment to Sec. 15.32.030 (D) of the Municipal Code Exterior Property Requirements. Section 4 now reads: </p>
<p>No-mow or short grass prairie areas are preferred as an alternative to mowed lawn areas upon approval by the development department, provided the seed mix utilized contains not more than eighty percent permanent native grass, sedge or forb species, is expected to grow not more than twenty-four inches in height, and is managed to effectively control the influx and growth of invasive or noxious plant species.

<ul>
<li>As part of an ongoing effort to improve energy efficiency in Wauwatosa, the city renovated the Muellner Building at Hart Park to reduce energy usage by about 20 percent. It's just one of many strategies the Energy and Recycling Advisory Committee has looked at to conserve energy.</li>
<li>In the Tosa Room at the Muellner Building, which houses an ice rink used by local curlers, the city has installed a new low-emissivity ceiling that prevents heat from warming the ice. The old ceiling's high emissivity meant it radiated most of its energy to the ice. This increased the temperature of the ice, requiring more refrigeration to keep the ice rink from turning into a swimming pool. The low-E ceiling means less heat radiated to the ice sheet and less refrigeration required to keep the ice sheet at the proper temperature.</li>
<li>The building also received a more efficient air conditioning system for summer rentals. Formerly, the building used the same machine for air conditioning as it used to freeze ice, which meant it had to operate at lower temperatures than was actually needed to cool the building because it operated by freezing water.</li>
<li>These changes were recommended after the Energy and Recycling Advisory Committee conducted an audit of the building looking for inefficiencies. </li>
</ul><br><br><strong>4.2.1, Document an energy audit for a municipal building and show that your community is working to implement its recommendations</strong></strong></p><p>Wauwatosa has an active and engaged Sustainability Committee (formerly known as the Energy and Recycling Advisory Committee). Its mission is to champion environmentally sound practices fostering the City’s long-term livability and economic vitality.  The committee advises the Common Council and City staff on sustainability matters, and collaborates with residents, businesses and other partners to advance the City’s environmental goals. Many of the city's suatainability objectives can be found here <a href="https://www.wauwatosa.net/discover-tosa/sustainability" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.wauwatosa.net/discover-tosa/sustainability</a></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">The Committee and City have embarked on a program to convert all streetlights to LED, which will reduce energy usage by approximately 1,500,000 KWH per year and save the City an estimated $105,000 annually. The City owns about 6,000 street lights. Approximately half of these lights have already been converted to LED fixtures through various capital improvement programs with the remaining half planned to be replaced by 2021.</span></p><br><br><strong>4.2.2, Show that your community has implemented a sustainability plan that improves your community's energy efficiency and/or increases the use of renewable energy. (Exclusions: Smart Growth comprehensive plans)</strong></strong></p><p>In April 2021, the City of Wauwatosa, partnering with Arch Electric, completed the installation of a solar panel system on the building complex that includes City Hall, the Civic Center and the Library.  This will reduce the city's annual energy cost by $40,000.</p>
<p>In 2019, the City  partnered with McKinstry to design, install, commission and monitor solar panels on the roof of the city’s Public Works Facility. The project is expected to meet an estimated 96% of the facility’s annual electricity consumption, as well as reduce CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>In addition to substantial energy cost savings, the City of Wauwatosa will receive more than $100,000 in incentives through the Renewable Energy Competitive Incentive Program (RECIP) offered by Focus on Energy. The statewide utility program provides incentives for cost-effective renewable energy systems installed at eligible Wisconsin businesses through a competitive proposal process. The combination of these incentives and annual energy savings will cover the cost of the Wauwatosa solar project at the Public Works Building.  See attachment Category 5F - Solar  panel installation at DPW building.</p>
<p>In 2017, Wauwatosa partnered with Midwest Renewable Energy Association to create the Solar Tosa program. Solar Tosa is a grassroots residential and commercial group purchasing program for solar energy. Home and business owners throughout Wauwatosa participated in this program to help pool their buying power to secure significant discounts that make installing solar more affordable than ever. 120 kW of solar were added on 24 properties in Wauwatosa as a result of this program. <a href="https://www.growsolar.org/solar-tosa/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.growsolar.org/solar-tosa/</a> </p><br><br><strong>4.2.3, Demonstrate that your community participates in a community solar program or that a municipal building receives a significant percentage of its electricity from renewable energy</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Wauwatosa has been a Green Tier Legacy City in good standing since 2017.

<p>In 2020, the Common Council approved a resolution adopting clean energy goals to reduce municipal emissions to 50% of 2010 levels by 2030, in line with global goals, source at least 25% of all energy from local renewable sources by 2025, and achieve municipal and community carbon neutrality by 2050.  The resolution can be found in the attachment Category 5I - Clean Energy Goals.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Common Council approved 2 additional resolutions that support the City's efforts on energy independence.  See attachment Category 5I - resolution supporting the energy innovation and carbon dividend act in the US Congress; and attachment Category 5I - Resolution authorizing the City to join the Wisconsin Local Government Climate Coalition (WLGCC).</p></p>
