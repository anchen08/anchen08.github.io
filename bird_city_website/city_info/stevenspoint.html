<p>North Central Conservancy Trust (NCCT) is the primary land preservation group in central Wisconsin. Historically, they have developed 53 easement properties totaling 4,407 acres, including some in the Stevens Point area. Our Audubon chapter, the Green Circle Trail Board, and the City of Stevens Point have developed a productive and collaborative working relationship with NCCT. This involves holding legal documents for selected easements.  ALAS donated $7,500 to purchase and renovate their new headquarters located in the Village of Whiting. The land easements provide migrating and seasonal  nesting habitat for thousand of birds representing over 200 species.</p>
<p>In 2020, ALAS continued to develop a bird habitat and bird viewing area in conjunction with Schmeeckle Reserve, a part of the University of Stevens Point. It is located right at the administrative office location of the Reserve.  For bird habitat, we planted "bird friendly" trees,  put in an artificial stream and placed a dozen or so bird feeding stations within the habitat. The idea was to develop a model backyard habitat that viewers could use for developing their own backyard habitat. An area for children and adults to view the birds coming to this habitat was developed. This area was equipped with binoculars and bird guides to help with the identification of birds coming to these feeding stations. Viewers have already documented 30+ species of birds coming to these feeders. This area now attracts hundreds of viewers each year.</p>
<p>Finally, the non-profit group Wild Ones partnered with the City of Stevens Point to plant over 1500 native plant species along the bank of the Wisconsin River and adjacent to the Green Circle Trail. These plants play a critical role in preserving and enhancing this stretch of shoreline in the city owned Pioneer Pfiffner Park.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Stevens Point continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1980. The City has also received a Tree City's Growth Award for the past 16 years, and this award has been applied for consideration again in 2023. An Arbor Day celebration was held in Stevens Point in the Fall of 2021. 24 fruit trees were planted in the newly acquired area north of Bukolt Park adjacent to the Green Circle Trail for use by birds and those using the Trail for exercise.</p>
<p>Audubon applied for a $750 grant from Audubon National for replacing trees damaged by the summer storm of 2017.  It was received it and donated it to the Forestry Dept. of Stevens Point. ALAS added an additonal $649 for a total grant of $1,399.  Audubon members have worked with City staff to help plant many trees through this reforestation project.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong></strong></p><p>In 2019, the City Council developed a <strong>Beekeeping Ordinance </strong>for the City of Stevens Point.  It is modeled after Wisconsin Statute 94.76 and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection ATCP Chapter 21.23 regarding beekeeping and transportation of bees.  This ordinance has proved to be quite popular and is definitely in the best interests of ecosystems (including birds).</p>
<p>In addition, the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point has been recognized as a "Bee Campus-USA".  One of only three state campuses certified as a Bee Campus USA, the university maintains gardens across campus that use very limited amounts of pesticides and maintains habitat for pollinating insects.</p>
<p>The City of Stevens Point Dept. of Forestry and ALAS are cooperating to develop four acres of prairie pollinator garden with American Transmission Company. We have received $4,500 in grants from ATC for this project. We have cleared the first acre under the power lines of Koziczkowski Park and killed competing vegetation with roundup. ATC has cleared an additional three acres and they were treated  with roundup in the spring and summer of 2021. In the winter of 2020 we planted the first prairie seeds in acre #1, and in the spring of 2021 we planted plugs to enrich the pollinator prairie in the first acre.  The other measure taken was in 2022 to manually remove a significant growth of garlic mustard in this area. Local Boy Scout members also participated in this activity.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong></strong></p><p>Todd Ernster, Stevens Point City Forester, has completed the Wisconsin DNR's WI Community Tree Management Institute course.

Volunteers continue to maintain excellent rapport with administrators at these golf courses, which allows golfers to get educated regularly about conservation of songbirds from nest box monitors.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection. (Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>15 acres of prime bird habitat lie in the Stevens Point area.  This 15 acres encompasses city park land known as Koziczkowski Park and the Erickson Natural Area, and is used by birders year round. Home to dozens of migrating species, it is a confirmed nesting site for 33 bird species, including the Osprey.  ALAS was instrumental in preserving from development a 5.5 acre site adjacent to the 14 acre Koziczkowski Park, owned by the City of Stevens Point.  In less than one year, Audubon and friends raised $308,000 for purchase of what is now known as the Godfrey &amp; Maybelle Erickson Natural Area.  Audubon members alone raised nearly $32,000. The Erickson family contributed $60,000, the City of Stevens Point $75,710,  and the Wisconsin DNR contributed $140,500 through its Urban Space Program.</p>
<p>Koziczkowski Park and the Erickson Natural Area continue to be used for visitation by local citizens, tourists and special Audubon field trips.  In 2011 ALAS added two Leopold benches to the site and were involved in the removal of the invasive species black locust and tatarian honeysuckle. In the late winter of 2014, a pier on McDill Pond was added to this property.  It is used by McKinley Elementary School students to fish, bird watch and take water samples.  This area is a very important <b>stop over site</b> for Neotropical migrants. </p>
<p> ALAS has enhanced this property with an educational kiosk, two boardwalks, an entryway sign, and removal of invasive species (for seven years).</p>
<p>ALAS has held the following activities at the Koziczkowski Park/ENA site: bird walks, including two World Migratory Bird Day celebrations; 13 years of nest box inspection; and Cavity nesting songbird Workshops for central Wisconsin in 2009 and for the Natural Resources Foundation in 2010.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong></strong></p><p>The Green Circle Trail is a biking, walking, and bicycling opportunity encompasses four municipalities (Stevens Point, Whiting, Hull and Plover). This is a 26 mile trail, with 23 miles of “spurs” that connect the original trail to various points of interest. The Green Circle passes through many habitats that are favorable to birds.  Bird watching is common on the trail and is especially appealing along the Wisconsin River, where ducks, geese and swans are common to see during the Spring and Fall migration. The trail is maintained through agreements with local municipalities, ensuring that fragile animal habitat surrounding it is protected.</p>
<p>Kiosks are placed at the intersections of trail segments for the Green Circle.  Audubon has helped pay for two of these kiosks ($9,000), and fundraising continues for others being erected. In 2023 and beyond., One new kiosk was completed in 2021, with another planned for 2023. Each of these Kiosk segments has its own descriptive panel that features a bird species, while a bird species list has been developed for the major segments of the Green Circle Trail and is available on the Green Circle Trail website.</p>
<p>In 2020, a 5.13 acre parcel of land was purchased next to the city owned Bukolt Park by the North Central Conservancy Trust (NCCT).  This parcel has now become part of the Green Circle Trail, and is a great example of the cooperation between the City of Stevens Point, the Green Circle, and NCCT in preserving green space in an urban environment. </p>
<p>An major extension of the Green Circle Trail is being planned for in the future that will connect the eastern edge of Stevens Point and the Town of Hull to the main section of the Green Circle. This extension would include a walking/biking bridge over the Plover River, Resulting not only in trail expansion but more areas for individuals to view wildlife along that river basin. The City is negotiating a purchase of land necessary to the trail expansion, and grant opportunities/fundraising are being explored.</p>
<p>Finally, the Trailhead project for the Green Circle Trail is now complete, with Menzel Pavilion now being used for events. The Menzel Pavilion is an open-air shelter featuring a two-story, double-sided fireplace, stone columns, a cedar roof, uncovered patio area, and seating for 50 people. This project involved the City of Stevens Point, the Green Circle, and the University of Stevens Point.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

The others are at Grant Elementary School, SW Portage Co., Wisconsin Rapids, Port Edwards &amp; Nekoosa.</p>
<p>In mid-April of each breeding season, students involved in this program had collectied data from their nest boxes around their respective schools. Most trails had at least three species of birds nesting, and sometimes four (bluebird, Tree Swallow, chickadee and wren). Students learned to ID nests, eggs and chicks, and how to collect accurate data on specially prepared data sheets.

For 5-7 weeks they then investigate 6-8 nest boxes (donated by ALAS) and record the contents. They were able to observe nest building, egg laying and chick hatching. They were taught by volunteers how to handle chicks and dispel the myth that human smells cause the parents to abandon the chicks. This program had been very well received by the students, their teachers and their parents. As noted earlier, this program is curretly being reviewed by ALAS for coninuationin 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>ALAS joined with the Portage County Master Gardener Program during the 2022 Annual Garden Parade by locating an ALAS booth at one of the six gardens on display. This was the fifth opportunity for ALAS to provide information about its mission during this annual gardening event, attended by hundreds of interested plant lovers.</p>
<p>A new initiative created by ALAS  during the Covid pandemic when schools went virtual invites children (and adults!) to join a zoom class that involves the drawing of a different bird each time the zoom class is held. A local artist donates her time and expertise to this initiative. This initiative continued in 2022, and it has proved to be very popular!</p>
<p>The mission of the Central Wisconsin Children’s Museum (CWCM), located in downtown Stevens Point, is to provide a family-based discovery place where children and adults can play and explore together to strengthen confidence, capabilities and creativity through hands-on investigation. This investigation includes a multitude of environmental issues and concepts.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Aldo Leopold Audubon Society developed and funded the following initiatives with the CWCM, initiatives that continue to serve children and families today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bird Wing Display: Children hold their arms up and compare them to the wingspread of an eagle, hawk, owl, etc. This remains a very active display. </li>
<li>Cavity-nesting Songbird Display: Nests and eggs of Eastern Bluebird, Black-capped Chickadee, House Wren, and Tree Swallow are displayed in viewable, plexiglass containers. </li>

No specific bird counts were available at the time of this writing. Monitoring occurred  from mid-April to mid-July. </p>
<p>For the past 19 years, the Aldo Leopold Audubon Society (ALAS) has developed and monitored an Eastern Bluebird trail. This trail has grown from 89 to over 1,000 boxes and the number of monitors has increased from 1 to 65 monitors.  For the last 10 years, this trail has been the largest and most productive Eastern Bluebird trail in Wisconsin. For the last 7 years is was thought to be the largest and most productive trail in the U.S. In the 20 years of its activity, the ABT has produced over 101,000 songbirds, of which over 74,500 were bluebirds.

<p><br><br><strong>4.1.1, Describe your community's efforts to educate residents about climate change</strong></strong></p><p>Since 2013, the waste water treatment plant in Stevens Point has used methane gas from its waste water intake to power its generator.  After receiving a $114,000 grant from the state agency, Focus on Energy, that efficiency reached a remarkable 95%. The former Director of the plant, Joel Lemke,noted that the waste water department might reach a point where it can actually generate power and sell it back to the power grid. This effort is remarkable because release of methane contributes 23 times the effect for global warming that Co2 does, so its importance cannot be overstated.  This year the plant developed the technology to upgrade its solid waste from a Class B to a moisture-less, Class A level.  This solid waste is used by a local farmer on his crop fields.</p>
