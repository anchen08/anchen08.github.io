<p>Additionally, there are current efforts to review and reestablish bird habitat (amongst other wildlife habitat) within Lake Pacawa Park. In conjunction with Canadian National Railway and America in Bloom there will be additional plantings and landscaping features installed Spring/Summer of 2022 to not only further enhance the scenic beauty of the area but to also re-establish habitat for local wildlife including birds. There will be a variety of species and types of vegetation planted including flowers, grasses, shrubs, and trees. In addition to the work being done with America in Bloom the Village of Plover will be investing additional funding into re-establishing the natural areas within the park to improve wildlife habitat. Due to recent strong wind events over the last 2 years there have been several large trees within the park that have been damaged or have fallen, these planting efforts will ideally offset the loss of these large trees with a multitude of species and types of vegetation to create a wild break from nearby agricultural fields. The plantings will also further diversify the wooded areas within the park to be more suitable for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>As a part of the Springville Pond Management Plan update, wildlife habitat is a crucial component of the plan which is intended to educate and encourage residents and pond users to establish, promote, and preserve key habitats along the pond and within the watershed. The Village has been working with Portage County Conservation Staff to update the plan while collaborating with local experts related to invasive species, water quality, wildlife habitat, as well as recreational opportunities to provide the most cohesive and collaborative experience for all the pond users while minimizing the potential impacts on aquatic and avian wildlife. </p>
<p>Lastly, the Village of Plover has been researching additional grant funding related to ongoing and continued habitat restoration and maintenance to ensure the parks and conservation areas can be managed long term given the high amount of effort and funding that have been invested over the years.  </p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The Little Plover River (LPR) has been a conservation nightmare for the past 10+ years.  Certain segments of the stream have dried up in the past and the stream is listed as one of the 10 most endangered streams in the U.S. -- it is a Class I trout stream.  A major reason segments of the stream dry up is due to high capacity wells which dot the watershed.</p>
<p>The Village of Plover, along with its partners identified in Section 1D, organized significant conservation efforts to address the problems of the LPR watershed while also improving wildlife habitat.  Note that this watershed is partially outside the village, but the LPR runs through the Village. To address its long-term health, problems in the watershed must be addressed.  The Plover Village Administration previously led by Dan Mahoney, has wisely solicited the help from other organizations to help this project realize success (see above). Although some shrub planting work remains, these efforts can already be seen as a success and are being used as an example for similar watersheds in other areas of the state.</p>
<p>Village staff, partners, and the Little Plover River Watershed Enhancement project team meet periodically throughout the year to address ongoing projects as well as potential grants, programs, and opportunities to provide education to those in the watershed, expand conservation lands and efforts, as well as analysis how the conservation efforts have been impacting the local wildlife, water quality and quantity, as well as improves agricultural efficiency. We believe these efforts will continue to both showcase how collaborative and volunteer efforts can be effective and efficient while also looking for ways to make improvements within the watershed. </p>
<p>Lastly, the within the VIllage of Plover and more specificly at the Plover Public Library the Master Gardner Jill Ziehr manages and maintains all the landscape and garden beds for the property (Village owned). She provides educational signage, storywalks, as well as hosts small groups in corrdination with the Libary to educate the general public and students about the unique aspects and benifits native plants and gardens have on local wildlife. </p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of Plover continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1993. Each spring, the Village holds a ceremony combining Tree City USA and Bird City Wisconsin. This ceremony usually involves school children in the community and receives advertising in the local papers.  No in-person event was held in 2020 in response to COVID-19 protocols, which was in line with Arbor Day Foundation policy. In 2022 the Village of Plover was awarded the Tree City designation for the 2021 year. The Village has also applied for Tree City USA recognition again in 2023 for the 2022 year and is awaiting verification. </p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong></strong></p><p>Roy Hopfensperger, Village of Plover's Asst. Public Works Manager, has completed the WDNR's Community Management Institute.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>As noted in Document 1D-2, the Village of Plover, along with its partners, have taken hundreds of acres of irrigated cropland and restored it to a combination of grasses/sedge meadow, dry-mesic/sand prairie, and wetlands. In doing so, this area not only helps restore groundwater flows to the Little Plover River, but also provides quality habitat to a diverse array of birds and other wildlife. </p>
<p>Additionally, as indicated in 1.D within the Lake Pacawa Park there will be additional vegetation plantings come spring and summer 2022 to provide more scenic beauty and wildlife habitat. There will be an estimated 50 trees planted and 460 ground covers, shrubs, and flowers planted under the America in Bloom grant funding. Additional plantings will also be done as a part of the Lake Pacawa Park project Phase 2 yet the documentation attached is specifically related to the America in Bloom grant application and approval.</p>
<p>In 2022 the Village of Plover and its partners began working with Portage County and their consultants on a wetland and stream restoration project proposed north of the Village owned Soik Wetland Restoration area which would convert 65+ acres from irrigated ag to historical wetland conditions. Although this project would be managed and owned by Portage County the Village of Plover is a partner in the planning and implementation of the restoration to ensure it has positive connectivity with the existing wetland property owned by the Village.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection. (Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Village of Plover owns 16 acres of property at their Water Department.  In the summer of 2017, Kent Hall did a bird survey on the property and found 29 species of birds.  In three visits, he judged 14 of these as breeding birds and 10 as probable breeders -- used WI Breeding Bird Atlas II criteria to make these judgments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In addition, the Village of Plover owns a 40 acre piece of property in their flood protection zone west of Boston School Forest.  They have permitted BSF to make multiple use of this property for educational purposes.  No survey has been conducted on this property, but "walk throughs" have given evidence of several breeding birds. Additionally, this property is used and managed to promote outdoor engagement and education for the local residents and schools, where students come to learn more about the natural environment including bird and wildlife habitat, sustainability practices, as well as localized farming alternatives. More information about the property and facilities can be found on their website: <a href="https://www.pointschools.net/bostonschoolforest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.pointschools.net/bostonschoolforest</a> </span></p>
<p>Lastly, the Village of Plover owns approximately 75 acres of land that encompass the Lake Pacawa Park, within this park there are no pets allowed (off of the existing trails) and there are several birders whom frequent the area for bird watching. The parcel(s) are also zoned Conservancy which has specific requirements and limitations related to uses onsite. 5+ acres of this park (southeast side of the park/lake) has been managed to promote natives species, birding habitat as well as incorporates minimally intrusive trails to further engage the residents and visitors in the natural landscape. </p>
<p>The Village owns and manages a 135 acre conservancy east of the Village (Danial R Mahoney Conservancy) where there are ongoing conservation efforts taking place which are intended to promote birding habitat (re-established prairie landscape for the majority of the land with a large forested area on the east side). 2022 conservation efforts included but were not limited to forest management (invasive removal and treatment) through a forest/birding grant in cooperation with the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, educational tours and meetings, stream monitoring, and a 10 acre prescribed burn.</p>
<p>In addition to the Daniel R Mahoney Conservancy, the Village owns and manages a 76+/- acre wetland conservancy east of the Village (the Soik Wetland Restoration Area) where an irrigated agricultural field was converted to a wetland through grant and Village funding. The intent behind the restoration was to bring the property back to its historical wetland characteristics. In 2022 the Village and its partners planted over 5,000 shrubs, performed invasive removal and treatment, worked with the local fire departments and DNR to conduct a prescribed burn on the whole property in march 2022, lead several educational tours, as well as began working with Portage County and consultants on an additional wetland/stream restoration project (just to the north of the Village lands which would be interconnected to the existing conservation efforts lead by the Village of Plover and its partners. </p>
<p>All of the Village owned and managed properties are under use and access easements through the Wisconsin DNR which limits the permitted uses, activities, and access by the Village as well as the general public to better preserve and enhance the landscape and conservation efforts. These areas are intended to be preserved and managed accordingly into perpetuity.  </p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong></strong></p><p>As noted in Document 1D-2, the Village of Plover, along with its partners, have taken hundreds of acres of irrigated cropland and restored it to a combination of grasses/sedge meadow, dry-mesic/sand prairie, and wetlands. In doing so, this area not only helps restore groundwater flows to the Little Plover River, but also provides quality habitat to a diverse array of birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>in 2022 the Village has worked with Portage County to interconnect a proposed 65+ acre wetland and stream restoration project north of the Village owned wetland site. Restoration work will included stream work, converting irrigated ag to historical characteristics, the establishment of a wetland bank, as well as other forest management.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of Plover has a variety of projects throughout the municipality yet two specific projects come to mind, the first being the Little Plover River Restoration Project and the second being the Lake Pacawa Park project. The Little Plover River Restoration project involves not only re-establishing substantial woodland, prairie, and wetland areas along the corridor and within the watershed but includes working with UWSP, their staff and students to do forest management within the existing woodland areas to remove invasive species and promote native habitat.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Village of Plover began  working with McCain Foods in 2022 to review, establish, and incorporate tree planting programs, initiatives, and opportunities to plant 18,000 new trees in the community as a part of McCain Foods recent plant expansion where they removed 6,000 trees/seedlings/saplings. McCain Foods has committed to plant three times the number of trees that were removed in the community and Village staff will be working with them in early 2023 to establish these programs for private and public properties in the area. The Village looks forward to this partnership as well as being able to hold educational workshops, special events, and community wide imitative programs to promote tree and native vegetation planting. </p><br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids. (Recommendations for SE WI)</strong></strong></p><p>Attached you will find the Trees and Shrubs Ordinance which regulates the types and number of trees and vegetation allowed on public lands. A variety of species are permitted yet native species which are consistent with the local climate are preferred and in many cases required for new developments and street projects to provide habitat as well as minimize maintenance costs.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.5, Attach a copy of a local ordinance to demonstrate that your community does not restrict natural/native landscaping that emphasizes native plants and non-turf lawns</strong></strong></p><p>Currently, the village does not restrict natural/native landscaping, additionally there are some regulations within the zoning code of ordinances that limits the total area a parcel can have that is a manicured lawn. These restrictions are established per Chapter 550-34 Wellhead Protection Overlay District and vary within the three district Districts which go from more to less restrictive, yet within all three of the Districts (A, B, and C) there are limitations on the total area a parcel can have that is manicured which would result in additional natural or green spaces for the land within those areas further providing bird habitat. Additionally, (where applicable) while going through the site plan review process, applicants and developers are encouraged to incorporate native species into there required landscaping plans.  Due to the climate and area in which Plover is located a lot of the species planted in these instances are native to Wisconsin.</p>
<p>As a part of ongoing ordinance reviews and the revision process, the Village has entertained and has began drafting language related to allowing for more natural yards and landscapes where residents can intentionally plant and/or establish native "gardens" in large portions of their lawns which would promote pollinator and wildlife habitat while improving. These potential revisions will allow for more flexibility when residents want to convert their lawns to a more natural landscape while still providing an avenue for regulatory action for those properties that are a nuisance (neglected lawns with weeds and invasives). </p><br><br><strong>1.4.1, Show that your community offers the public information on how they can control and remove invasive species in order to improve or maintain bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The Village provides facebook posts related to invasive species, bird habitat, potential bird hazards (windows and pets) throughout the years, as well as provides pamphlets and brochures at the municipal building with educational information related to the benefits of birds and improving bird habitat. The Village has been and will continue to work with the Plover Library and the Master Gardener (Jill Ziehr) related to public education and resources for gardening, bird habitat, as well as the general importance of spending time in nature. As a part of the Springville Pond Management Plan update and the ongoing Springville Pond Management Committee meetings staff, committee members, and residents discuss options and alternatives to address both aquatic and terrestrial invasive species while maintaining and improving native species which are habitat for birds and other species. </p><br><br><strong>1.4.2, Demonstrate that your community offers a program for private property owners who are interested in dealing with invasive plants that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Through the Portage County Conservation Department and in coordination with the Springville Pond Management Committee (Village Committee), staff have worked with several property owners (3-4) along the pond who have applied for and will be implementing shoreline conservation practices under the Healthy Lakes and River Grant including but not limited to: Fish Sticks, Native Plantings, Diversion Practices, and Rain Gardens. Through this grant program many of the shoreline owners will be looking to remove invasive along the shoreline where they can then plant native species which are beneficial for pollinators, birds, erosion control as well as water quality. The Village of Plover being one of the larger shoreline owners along the pond has also signed up for native plantings for its property on the south side of the pond to reestablish vegetation to better promote healthy shoreline habitat.</p>
<p>Village and County staff in cooperation with the Springville Pond Management Committee and its residents will be scheduling educational workshops over the next year to better educate shoreline property owners and pond users about the important of native shoreline vegetation, minimal pesticide application, wildlife habitat as well as other conservation practices. </p>
<p>Lastly, as a part of the Villages Comprehensive Parks and Recreation Plan update Village staff will be potentially creating a new program aimed at involving local residents in a adopt a park/landscape bed where they will be encouraged and rewarded for maintaining portions of the parks while removing invasive and getting creative with planting and management options. The program has yet to be created given the plan is still being drafted yet from the active survey the majority of those respondents has showed interest in these types of programs. In addition to the programs above the Parks Development Committee will be exploring additional options for community engagement as the draft plan moves through the review, adoption, and implementation process in early 2023. </p><br><br><strong>1.4.3, Show that your community works on public lands to control invasive species that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Plover is part of the Green Circle Trail -- 4.5 miles of the GCT are found in Plover (Hoover Rd. Trail).  This trail connects to 22 miles of additional GCT (plus another 13 miles of spurs).  Long-range plans include building 12 educational kiosks (10 of which are built and all list birds which are found along the GCT).  In addition, the Hoover Rd. Trail is part of the GCT Birding Trail featured on the GCT website.  Over 200 species of birds are listed on the GCT and many of them are found along the Hoover Rd. Trail.</p>
<p>Also, the Tomorrow River Trail connecting Plover with Manawa (29 miles of trail) has its Trail Head in Plover.  This area is well-maintained, with prairie and the start of a wooded area.  The Trail is now graveled and allows bikes and horses on it in summer and snowmobiles in winter.  The sides of the trail are left in a natural state and harbor dozens of breeding birds (trail is an old railroad bed).</p>
<p>Although the work has not yet been completed, as discussed in the previous sections the Village of Plover will be planting a vast variety of native species and will be creating educational kiosks/informational posters to be installed in Lake Pacawa Park as apart of Phase 2 and 3 of the park revitalization. The Village anticipates some of these educational “posters” and kiosks will include information and educational materials related to bird habitat and history of some common/rare bird species in the area. These educational items are proposed to be placed throughout the park in different locations with a variety of educational information located on them. </p><br><br><strong>1.5.1, Implement a municipal moratorium on the trimming of trees and shrubs and the mowing of ditches, storm water retention basins, and other grasslands from May 15 to July 15 to prevent the destruction of active bird nests.

In addition, the ABC brochure “Cats, Birds &amp; You” are distributed for free by the Village to the Portage County Humane Society, Oakview Medical Center, Inc., and Woodhaven Animal Health Veterinary Clinic. These three sites use 100-200 of these brochures each year. It is important to note that cats are the leading killer of birds and kill an estimated 1,000 times more birds than wind turbines. </p>
<p>The Village will also be increasing its efforts in 2022-2023 to better educate current and future pet owners (through engagement at public events as well as providing educational materials to local animal shelters and the humane society) related to ways they as residents can prevent unnecessary bird deaths and other negative impacts related to domesticated animals.</p><br><br><strong>2.1.2, Document a program that effectively reduces feral cat populations (Note: See 3F for enforced ordinances).

The Window Alert site demonstrates what to use and how to use window decals to prevent window collisions.  On October 17, 2020 Bryan Lenz talked to 67 people on the topic of "Birds, Windows and You". Bryan is Collision Coordinator for the American Bird Conservancy, a leading bird organization. He shared his knowledge of both commercial and home collisions. His information was important for preventing collisions with typical home windows and benefited those attending from the Village of Plover. Brochures are available at the Village Municipal building and staff can provide further insight to the public as requested. </p><br><br><strong>2.2.2, Demonstrate that your community has enacted a bird collision monitoring program and has treated problem windows to reduce collisions with municipal and commercial buildings</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.2.3, Document that a municipal or major public building has been awarded LEED certification as a bird-friendly building (LEED SSpc 55)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.2.4, Document that your community has registered a municipal building(s) in the Wisconsin Humane Society's WIngs BirdSafe Business program AND show that this building has made an effort to reduce window collisions (see ï¿½Things that can be done at businessesï¿½)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.2.5, Attach your community's ordinance that requires new buildings to be built following bird-safe design, construction, and operation guidelines (e.g., Toronto Green Standard, see Ecology: Bird Deterrence; San Francisco)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.3.1, Document that your community operates a significant Lights Out program that dims building lights to reduce collisions during spring and fall migration or that you have an outdoor lighting ordinance that includes Lights Out during bird migration</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.4.1, Show how your community regulates communication tower construction, siting, and lighting to mitigate their risk to migrating birds</strong></strong></p><p>Chapter 550-36 of the zoning code of ordinances addresses and regulates Wireless Communication Facilities, these regulations are intended to be consistent with Wisconsin statutes and are intended to limit the number of towers installed within the village while ensuring there is adequate access to internet and reliable cellphone connectivity. Limiting the number of towers and evaluating the locations of a proposed tower can ensure wildlife and other related concerns can be taken into consideration. All lighting has to be in compliance with FCC and FAA rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Lastly, per state statute 66.0401 and PSC 128 when and if there were to be a large scale wind or solar project within the village additional wildlife and habitat studies would need to be done to ensure the impact of the project is minimal and the development is designed in a manner to prevent adverse effects on rare or endangered species.</p></p>

Trail).  This trail connects to 22 miles of additional GCT (plus another 13 miles of spurs).  Long-range plans include building 12 educational kiosks (10 of which are built and all list birds which are found along the GCT).  In addition, the Hoover Rd. Trail is part of the GCT Birding Trail featured on the GCT website.  Over 200 species of birds are listed on the GCT and many of them are found along the Hoover Rd. Trail.</p>
<p>Also, the Tomorrow River Trail connecting Plover with Manawa (29 miles of trail) has its Trail Head in Plover.  This area is well-maintained, with prairie and the start of a wooded area.  The Trail is now graveled and allows bikes and horses on it in summer and snowmobiles in winter.  The sides of the trail are left in a natural state and harbor dozens of breeding birds (trail is an old railroad bed).</p>
<p>Although the work has not yet been completed, as discussed in the previous sections the Village of Plover will be planting a vast variety of native species and will be creating educational kiosks/informational posters to be installed in Lake Pacawa Park as apart of Phase 2 and 3 of the park revitalization. The Village anticipates some of these educational “posters” and kiosks will include information and educational materials related to bird habitat and history of some common/rare bird species in the area. These educational items are proposed to be placed throughout the park in different locations with a variety of educational information located on them. </p><br><br><strong>3.2.7, Document that a municipal building has significant bird-friendly landscaping that features native plants AND signage that explains the importance of native plants and providing diverse habitat for birds (e.g., brush piles, water features)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.3.1, Document a substantial regular program that educates young people on any of the following topics: climate change, energy efficiency, green/bird-safe buildings, or environmental sustainability</strong></strong></p><p>Aldo Leopold Audubon Society has eight different programs per year which address environmental concerns of children (examples found in Document 4H-1).  They also host 14 field trips (examples in Document 4H-2), some of which (World Migratory Bird Day) deal with many children.
