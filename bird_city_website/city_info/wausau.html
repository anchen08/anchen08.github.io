<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Wausau adopted the City of Wausau Comprehensive Plan that met Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” law on February 28, 2006 (City ordinance 61-5283) and has been in compliance since.</p>
<p>The city of Wausau has a whole chatper in its zoning code that talks about when development is planned.  If the area in question contains important bird habitat or sensitive natural areas there would be some restriction of development in those areas.  This information was shared by Sam Wessel, assistant planner for the city in 2021. </p>
<p> </p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Additional bird habitat is created through the planting of native species trees throughout the City of Wausau. For example, in 2013, the City of Wausau planted 578 trees while removing 514 poor quality trees including 120 Ash trees in preparation for Emerald Ash Borer management. Hackberry has been used as a common replacement tree due to its high value of shelter and food for native birds. Conifers have been mainly planted within the city parks.</p>
<p>Wausau Bird Club worked with the Director of Parks and Recreation, William Duncanson on steering the contractor to use as many native plant species as possible. Some natives being planted include:</p>
<p><em>Acer</em> P Emerald Queen (Native Maples), <em>Betula nigra</em>, <em>Celtis occidentalis</em>, <em>Quercus ellipsodalis</em> (Oak), <em>Amelanchier</em> (Serviceberry), <em>Viburnum</em>, New Jersey Tea and too many more to list. The contractor’s list was checked against Birdscaping in the Midwest by Mariette Nowak. Many species being planted were listed as “high bird value” and several as “very high bird value” concerning food value. Others are listed by Nowak as attracting birds and butterflies.</p>
<p>Wausau is currently renovating its Wisconsin River front. Wausau Bird Club worked with the park department to use as many native plantings as possible. “The public space along the Wisconsin River is the biggest, most elaborate parks project the city has seen in a lifetime” was the headline in the City Pages, a local newspaper.</p>
<p>Final planting including many native species was conducted at the Wisconsin River Front project in 2017.</p>
<p>The Riverlife Phase 2 was done in 2018. Again many native species were planted. According to Greg Freix, Park Operation Superintendent, "the new Riverlife project underway in town...has incorporated seldom mowed grass areas and some prairie areas." The Park Commission purchased 4 acres to add to the Dells of the Eau Claire county park.</p>
<p>In 2019 the Marathon County Conservation, Planning and Zoning Department applied and received a DNR grant to "implement a shoreland buffer restoration site at Barker-Stewart Island County Park."  Wausau Bird Club, Golden Sands RC &amp; D, Wausau/Marathon County Parks, Recreation and Forestry Department and the UW-Extension have all been brought into the project.  This quote from the grant application explains the goal of habitat restoration for birds.  "Once a haven for birds, the Barker-Stewart Island is so overrun with an invasive shrub, buckthorn, which out competes almost all native vegetation and is poisonous to birds.  The partners are planning to implement the shoreland restoration as a bird sanctuary.  Restoring this area as a bird haven will provide critical habitat to the birds that use the Wisconsin River as a migration corridor and for foraging.  The restored shoreland will also provide habitat to polinators like the Monarch butterfly, mammals, amphibians and turtles, like the Wood Turtle (threatened) and Blandings's Turtle (special concern)."     </p>
<p>In coordination with the Wausau/Marathon Parks, Recreation and Forestry Department the Wausau Bird Club received permission to plant native trees and shrubs to restore inland areas of Barker-Stewart Island to native habitat for birds. The club planted 2 bur oak, 3 red maple, 5 nannyberry shrubs and 5 gray dogwood shrubs. This is a long term project to eliminate the non-native species and replace with natives. </p>
<p>In 2020 installation of native species on Barker-Stewart continued.  The Wausau Bird Club planted 5 elm trees and 10 hazelnut shrubs.  Additionally, Wausau/Marathon County Parks, Recreation and Forestry Department removed large areas of non-native trees and shrubs.  That work will continue in 2021 and well as continued planting by the Club.  Not sure if additional habitat will be created but the Wausau/Marathon County Parks, Recreation and Forestry Department has updated its Outdoor Recreation Plan with "recommendations being made for nearly every park in the county."</p>
<p>The Wausau Bird Club continued its restoration of bird habitat on Barker-Stewart Island. 3 American Larch, 2 Yellow Birch, 5 American Cranberry Bush and woodland phlox, all native species were planted. </p>
<p>In 2022 Barker-Stewart Island restoration continued with the planting of five swamp white oak and 10 nannyberry native species.  In addition, Wausau Bird Club received a memorial donation and in honor of the person we planted one more swamp white oak and two snowberry shrubs. Wausau has the Eau Claire River Conservancy and additional acreage wasn't obtained but with help of Wausau Bird Club birdathon funds 3 boardwalks were constructed to allow visitors access to more of the property.  In 2022, DNR staff through their agreement with the Marathon County Forest seeded 1.04 miles of forest trails with a clover/grass mix which provides a valuable food source for ruffed grouse.</p>
<p> </p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Wausau Bird Club has a member on the Marathon County Forest Citizens’ Advisory Subcommittee of the Marathon County board of Supervisors representing bird watching. While being only an advisory group, the County’s Supervisors are made aware of issues the various members' groups they represent are interested in. Plus the subcommittee is charged at times with polling their group about issues the county forest administrator is concerned with.  In 2017 the Wausau Bird Club and birding community worked with the County Forest Administrator on the issue of logging and Cerulean Warbler presence.</p>
<p>In 2018 the Wausau Bird Club conducted a Cerulean Warbler survey for the forestry department using DNR criteria to determine if the warbler was in an area designated to be cut.  The Cerulean Warbler was not detected in the cut area but in another several Hooded Warblers were seen and heard. Their presence was reported to the Marathon County Forest Administrator. The Wausau Bird Club continues to have a presence on the Marathon County Forest Citizen's Advisory Sub-committee. In 2019 work was started on revising the 15 year comprehensive plan. This work on this committee gives the club input into policies that affect bird habitat within the county forests. This year the Wausau Bird Club formally voted to support the monitor of a local bluebird trail that was established 17 years ago and monitored by members of the club.  We are recognizing these volunteers and may support them monetarily if they need some supplies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Marathon County Forest Citizens’ Advisory Subcommittee gave its approval to the 15 year comprehensive plan after reviewing the entire piece.  It then went to the full county board and DNR for their approval in the fall of 2020. The Wausau Bird Club member feels that the plan protects habitat, waterways and forests all of which is good for the birds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">  The Wausau Bird Club continues to maintain its membership on the Marathon County Forest Citizens’ Advisory Subcommittee which enables the group to have a say in matters concerning forestry but also recreation in the area parks.  Both County Forest Administrator and the Director of Parks, Recreation and Forestry are on this committee.  In Marathon County there is a unique relationship between Wausau and the county because the Director oversees forestry in the county but also the city parks. </p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Wausau continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1981.

<p>Monk Botanical Gardens purchased 8 additional acres and are revising their Master Plan to decide how best to restore this new addition. </p>
<p>According to Kevin Fabel, city of Wausau employee, the Tribute Golf Course located in the city of Wausau added a new hole of roughly 4.5 acres.  Todd Clendenning, Tributes's course Superintendent, has detailed all the efforts the course is doing to make it a great place for birds.  See the list in the attachment.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong></strong></p><p>In 2019 the Wausau Bird Club started a long term project on Barker-Stewart Island to restore it with native trees and shrubs.  Wausau planted 399 native trees and shrubs in the Riverlife II project.</p>
<p>The Wausau Bird Club continued its Barker-Stewart Island restoration of native species in 2020.</p>
<p>With the approval of the city of Wausau the Wausau Bird Club has again planted native species on Barker-Stewart Island in 2021.</p>
<p>John Kahon, forester for Marathon County which oversees the Park Department, advised that of the 406 trees planted in Wausau in 2022 146 were natives.  </p><br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

<p>Once again on October 12, 2018 the GSRCDC organized students from Wausau East High School to remove buckthorn and honeysuckle from Fern and Oak Islands located in the Wisconsin River.</p>
<p>At the 2019 Garden Visions one of the workshops was entitled "Invasive Species and Their Stories."  The presenter described what invasive species are and why not to add to the landscape.</p>
<p>Monk Botanical Gardens has a sign entitled "What Makes Woody Invasive Plants a Problem?"  The sign identifies Buckthorn, Honeysuckle and Russian Olive and explains why they are bad for the landscape.  It recommends removing these species.</p>
<p>The goats increased the public's awareness of Barker-Stewart Island and the removal of invasive species.  Andrew Sims reported that there was an increase in visitors to the park and he hopes that will continue which he says will increase awareness of the at least 78 species that have been documented there.</p>
<p> </p>
<br><br><strong>1.4.2, Demonstrate that your community offers a program for private property owners who are interested in dealing with invasive plants that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.4.3, Show that your community works on public lands to control invasive species that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>In 2017, Wausau again hosted the Golden Sands Environmental Group’s Invasive Species Workshop and conducted invasive plant species removal work days at Fern Island and Riverside Parks.</p>
<p>2018 again saw a Golden Sands work day to remove invasive plant species at Fern and Oak Islands.</p>
<p>In October 2019 a work party removed buckthorn, honeysuckle and alder from the shoreline of Barker-Stewart Island.  The Wausau Bird Club worked under the direction of Golden Sands RC &amp; D and the Shoreland Protection Technician.</p>
<p>In 2020 the Marathon County Park department began removal of invasive shrubs in the interior of Barker-Stewart Island. The Mayor of Wausau has suggested bringing goats to complete the removal but that is still under review. </p>
<br><br><strong>1.5.1, Implement a municipal moratorium on the trimming of trees and shrubs and the mowing of ditches, storm water retention basins, and other grasslands from May 15 to July 15 to prevent the destruction of active bird nests.

<p>In 2021 at the Eastbay Soccer Comples mowing of areas surrounding the soccer fields has been reduced to mowing once or twice later in summer which avoids the spring nesting time for any ground nesting birds using the longer grass.  This is according to Kevin Fabel from the city of Wausau.</p><br><br><strong>1.5.2, Implement a tree-risk policy that includes specific plans to leave dead trees standing as nesting and foraging resources for birds when it is safe to do so (follow Urban Tree Risk Management, especially pg. 153)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.6.1, Demonstrate the implementation of a program to preserve Chimney Swift nesting and roosting sites (preferred) and/or to construct Chimney Swift towers</strong></strong></p><p>The Wausau Bird Club constructed two Chimney Swift towers. One was placed at REGI in Antigo and the other will be placed by the Aldo Leopold Audubon Society in Stevens Point. The Wausau Bird Club in the summer of 2015 constructed another Chimney Swift tower and erected at the Robert W. Monk Botanical Gardens. The club continues to monitor each of its chimneys along with clean out.</p>
<p>Wausau Bird Club has made several Prothonotary Warbler nest boxes and monitors them continuously. Two were placed along the Eau Claire River on the Holtz-Krause property and two along the Wisconsin River. To date no birds have moved this far north but we are ready.  In 2017 one of the Prothonotary Warbler boxes was moved to the Mead Wildlife area.  Prothonotary Warblers were seen in the area and when the boxes are checked this winter, we will see if they used the box.</p>
<p>No Chimney Swifts were found in our annual 2018 inspection of our tower at the Monk Botanical Gardens.  Work began on designing a sign explaining everything Chimney Swifts to erect in front of the tower.</p>
<p>In 2019 installation of the Wausau Bird Club's professionally done educational sign was erected by our chimney swift tower at the Monk Botanical Gardens. Once again no swifts have started to use our tower.</p>
<p>Chimney swifts are see in the Monk Botanical Gardens but no evidence has been found that they used our tower in 2020.</p>
<p>The tower at Monk Botanical Gardens was again inspected in 2021 but unfortunately no chimney swifts have used it.</p>

Two houses were erected in 2010, and are continually monitored by the club and the public. The city is considering relocating one of the two houses but both will continue to be used.</p>
<p>In 2017 one Martin house was taken down and repaired.  It was then relocated by the city and Wausau Bird Club to Blue Gill Bay Park.  The Wausau Bird Club continues to monitor the houses.</p>
<p>2018 again had Wausau Bird Club monitoring the two Purple Martin houses.  To date we still have not had any martins.</p>
<p>2019 was another year without any purple martins using out houses.  The houses continue to be maintained.</p>
<p>2020 saw no Purple Martins using our houses. Someone read or heard that it may take 10 years to get Martins so the Wausau Bird Club is still hopeful.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2021 it was determined that the 2 Purple Martin wooden houses the Wausau Bird Club had erected were rotten and no longer usable.  The club decided to purchase plastic gourd houses as a replacement.  Two arrays were constructed.  They were placed at DC Everest park in Wausau and the second one at the Mead Wildlife education center.  We were unable to remove the one at Blue Gill Bay park because it is part of a scavenger hunt run by the park department which should educate participants abount Martins.</p>
<p>In 2022, Martins were using the gourds at the Mead Wildlife Area.  The Wausau Bird Club purchased signs telling readers which specie the arrays were for and how to contact the Wausau Bird Club for more information.</p><br><br><strong>2.1.1, Describe your community's educational program to control free-roaming cats and/or the manner in which you actively publicize the Cats Indoors initiative</strong></strong></p><p>Wausau Bird Club purchases “Cats, Birds, and You” flyers from the American Birding Conservancy. The flyers have been placed at the Marathon County Humane Society, VCA (Vet clinic), Wisconsin Valley Vet Services and Wausau Mobile Pet Hospital. The flyers are placed in new cat owner folders. The feeling is that if you know the value of keeping your cat/kitten indoors you will start and continue this good practice. Monitoring and replacement of the flyers is done annually by the Wausau Bird Club.</p>
<p>In 2017 an additional five veterinary clinics were supplied with "Cats, Birds and You" flyers along with instructions on usage by the Wausau Bird Club.  Efforts continue to address the Trap, Neuter, Return program which was enacted in Wausau.  A member of Wausau Bird Club attended a presentation by Peter Marra, author of <em>Cat Wars.</em></p>
<p>Monitoring of the Cat flyers continued in 2018.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2022 the Wausau Bird Club contaced all the veterinary clinics in the Wausau area and asked if they would again give new cat owners the "Cats, Birds and You" brochures.  Eleven clinics were then provided with the item.</p><br><br><strong>2.1.2, Document a program that effectively reduces feral cat populations (Note: See 3F for enforced ordinances).

It reduces light pollution, saves energy, and protects wildlife by helping maintain normal nocturnal conditions. One specific nocturnal condition that affects birds is the impact light pollution has on the ability of birds to see stars needed for migration purposes.</p>
<p>The Wausau and Marathon County Parks Recreation and Forestry Department have adopted the practice of utilizing dark sky friendly outdoor light fixtures when possible on new lighting installations and when retrofitting existing systems. To date they have implemented the practice for roadway, parking lot and walkway lighting in several parks and on the majority of the River Edge Trail which borders the Wisconsin River in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>2019 saw Wausau incorporate additional dark sky lighting. </p>
<p>The Wausau Department of Public Works is considering adopting the practice and has implemented dark sky friendly lighting on a number of main arterial streets to study performance and cost factors.</p>
<p>These steps are leading to internal policies and potentially an ordinance requiring the use of dark sky friendly lighting in business and commercial developments. Through the City’s planning and permitting process they have been successful in achieving voluntary use of dark sky friendly fixtures in a number of new private developments including two auto dealerships and a gas station/convenience store/fast food outlet/car wash facility.</p>
<p>Additional dark sky lighting was installed on Grand Avenue during road reconstruction. During construction of County Hwy’s U and K dark sky lighting was erected.</p>
<p>In 2016, Wausau installed ROAM lighting which allows street lights to be dimmed when the volume of traffic lessens. This will help save energy and diminish light pollution.</p>
<p>In 2017 on 2nd Avenue in Wausau additional Dark Sky Lighting was installed as the area was refurbished.  Additional ROAM lighting was also installed in some neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Eric Lindman, director of public works, reported that the City of Wausau in 2018 installed more Dark Sky Lighting along Thomas Street which was recently widened. Also more ROAM lighting was installed on 7th Street.  These lights are all pre-programmed to shut off and not be on all night.  The decorative lights in the downtown area look great but actually due to mirrors &gt;90% of the light emitted is directed downward.  </p>
<p>In 2020 a new zoning code went into place.. It requires "full cut-off light fixtures for fixtures that are over 100 watt equivalent light output. It created lower limits for light spill beyond the property boundaries and reduced the maximum height of light fixtures." </p></p>

<h4>Public Education</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>2.5.1, Show that your municipality practices Integrated Pest Management, using natural pest control and the best available science to minimize pesticide and herbicide use</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Wausau uses Integrated Pest Management practices when practical. At the Eastbay Sports Complex natural weed control is used to ensure the safety of the athletes. Another example was used in 2017 on a planting of Asiatic lilies. Grubs were seen on the plants and an oil was used to control instead of an insecticide. All of the employees that use pesticides are certified pesticide applicators so they have been educated in safe practices.</p>
<p>In 2019 the Wausau and Marathon County Parks, Recreation and Forestry Department completed an overview of their pest management practices. "We adhere to the program of Integrated Pest Management and utilize cultural techniques as learned and applied through training and education prior to committing to use of products."</p>
<p>Garden Visions event 2020 included two sessions entitled: "Growing Healthy Plants - Basic in Plant Disease Management" and "Getting Your Lawn Off Drugs." Participants learned about ways to have a green lawn and healthy garden plants without the use of harmful herbicides and an excessive amount of fertilizers.</p>
<p>UW-Extension Marathon County offered in 2022 information on integrated pest management.   A short paragraph was printed in the City Pages, a free weekly newspaper in an April issue on "using a garden hose to spray plants to get rid of pests instead of using pestisides.  It provides the most bang for a buck."  </p><br><br><strong>3.1.1, Document and describe your event that incorporates the annual WMBD theme in some fashion.

The early-morning bird walk, which was attended by the Mayor of Wausau, was led by members of the Wausau Bird Club at the Monk Gardens. This year bird tattoos and stickers were purchased and given to all children in attendance.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Wausau Visitor Center again displayed bird watching flyers along with the IMBD 2016 poster. Another poster was also displayed at the Wausau City and Marathon County Park office.</p>
<p>Wausau's IMBD 2017 celebration again involved an early morning bird walk.  Discussion on protecting our birds here and on their wintering grounds took place.  The event held at the Monk Gardens included the annual Green Saturday Plant Sale and Garden Flea Market.  The event was held on May 20, 2017. </p>
<p>Wausau's recognition of World Migratory Bird Day in 2019 was Saturday, May 18</p>
<p>Saturday May 18, 2019, was Wausau's World Migratory Bird Day celebration at Monk Botanical Gardens.  Very cold morning but some migrants did appear for the bird walk participants.  A second WMBD event took place on May 20, 2019 as part of "All Things Senior"  this too included a bird walk in very windy conditions.  These seniors were educated on the importance of this "day."</p>
<p>Once again our World Migratory Bird Day 2019 event was held at the Monk Botanical Gardens in conjunction with their annual flea market and plant sale.  The day started with a bird walk looking for migrants.</p>
<p>2020 the Wausau Bird Club held a World Migratory Bird Day bird walk at the Monk Botanical Gardens on June 6,  </p>
<p>Wausau's World Migratory Bird Day 2021 walk is scheduled at the Monk Botanical Gardens for Saturday, May 15.</p>
<p>The Wausau Bird Club will celebrate World Migratory Bird Cay with the public at our Bird City partner Monk Botanical Gardens.  An early morning bird walk will be held along with discussions on Light Pollution.  Light Pollution is a major concern for migratory birds and is the focus of 2022's WMBD.</p>
<p> 2023 with a focus on the value of clean water to birds The Wausau Bird Club along with The Monk Botanical Gardens and the local Wild Birds Unlimited Store are hosting a World Migratory Bird Day event.  A bird walk will be conducted on the Gardens ground.  There will be games and crafts for the children.  Who knows maybe the games may involve water.  Education on water assets in our area will also be discussed with attendees.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane43"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_43"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_43"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_gallery cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_245"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_245" id="cblabcbfv_245"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong></strong></p><p>The Wausau Bird Club <a href="http://www.wausaubirdclub.com/birding-resources/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> has a link to the The National Audubon Society which has information on bird friendly habitat creation.</p>
<p>The local Wild Birds Unlimited store's website has links to the National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Habitat certification program.  In 2019 the city of Wausau currently has 35 gardens certified by the National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Habitat program.</p>
<p>The local Wild Birds Unlimited store has a FaceBook page with all kinds of tips on feeding birds by creating a welcoming habitat with plants.</p>
<p>The Wausau Bird Club has started a project at the Monk Botanical Gardens in 2022 educating visitors on using native, bird and pollinator friendly plants in a "home yard setting."A sign was commissioned this explaining why this is important and that starting small for example around your foundation can help birds and bees.  Natives were planted around a gazebo which stands in for a house.  Invasives were removed prior to the planting and education was done on that topic as well.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.2, Attach a state publication showing that there is a segment of the Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail or a designated Important Bird Area within or adjacent to your community</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Wausau contains a segment of the Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail. The Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum is #33 on Page 32 of the brochure.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.3, Demonstrate that your community actively raises awareness of its bird assets. Examples include placing a remote web camera on a nest platform; offering regular, public bird-watching field trips; or creating a significant educational resource on your community's birdlife</strong></strong></p><p>Wausau Bird Club has gotten listed in the Marathon County Recreation Guide so the public can find us. Wausau Bird Club applications and information sheets are located at various venues in the area. Wausau Bird Club has a link on the Marathon County website under the bird watching category.</p>
<p>The Wausau Bird Club continues its part in the adopt-a-highway program. A three-mile section of highway is cleaned adjacent to the Bitzke Bird Walk. Bitzke is part of the Watchable Wildlife program with signage to educate the public on the wildlife and birds.</p>
<p>All of the field trips sponsored by the Wausau Bird Club are advertised by the Wausau Visitor Center and through other local media and are always open to the public. In 2014 our field trips helped educate participants on several Wisconsin threatened bird species: our camping trip to Kohler-Andrae State Park produced Hooded Warbler, our participation in the Prairie Chicken festival educates on the Greater Prairie Chicken, our winter trip to the Nicolet Forest has us looking for Spruce Grouse and many local birders were rewarded with sightings of a Yellow-crowned Night-Heron on the Eau Claire River in eastern Marathon county.</p>
<p>Wausau Bird Club has updated its bird checklist of Marathon County and printed the new version in 2016. Unfortunately, as soon as we went to print a Painted Redstart showed up in the county!  So the checklists are already out of date! The checklist is available at the visitor center, the Park and Forestry building and at local retailers who sell bird feeding products.</p>
<p>The Wausau Bird Club in 2017 again offered field trips in the area.  Once again the Visitor Center featured a bird watching display in the lobby for the month of International Migratory Bird Day which is May.</p>
<p>Also there is much interest in our FaceBook page:  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/wausaubirdclub/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wausau Area Birders and Bird Watchers</a>.  There are monitors policing the site, events are posted, bird identification questions answered and sightings posted.  Over 400 people are members.</p>
<p>In 2018 the Wausau Bird Club hosted seven bird walks that are advertised to the public. We place flyers in stores, advertise on Visitor Center calendar and list walks on the Facebook page.  Facebook page membership has grown to over 550 members. </p>
<p>Increased interest in area bird related activities was seen in 2019.  The local Facebook page's membership increased to 679 people.  People share articles from many educational groups and conservation groups for all to read.  The Wausau Bird Club holds many walks throughout the year.  Including a trip to Duluth in January in -20 degree weather.  See picture of participants in Wausau Bird Club's ongoing road cleanup project.</p>
<p>The FaceBook group has grown to 846 members.  It is a great resource to help with bird specie identification.  Also members advise each other on feeding birds, feeder selection and maintenance. In spite of COVID the Wausau Bird Club held several bird walks. </p>
<p>The FaceBook group has increased to 993 members.  The members continue to share identification help and host feed discussions.  The Wausau Bird Club continues to host walks for the community.  In 2021 bird walks were held at Rib Mountain State Park and,Lake Wausau,  Other trips further afield were done in search of snowy and short eared owls.  The club is getting more notice and more groups are requesting our services.</p>
<p>By 2022 1.1K members are in the Facebook group now.  So many bearutiful photos are shared with the group.  The Wausau Bird Club continues to offer bird walks through out the area.  Favoites are searching for snowy owls and migrants on Lake Wausau.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.4, Provide a link to your community's Bird City Wisconsin webpage, which must be visible from the main page of your municipal website (it may be located at the first level of a drop-down menu on the main page but cannot be any less visible) OR demonstrate that your Bird City effort has a significant social media presence</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Wausau's <a href="http://www.ci.wausau.wi.us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> proudly displays the Bird City link.  </p><br><br><strong>3.2.5, Describe your community-sponsored annual bird festival.

Members of the Wausau Bird Club take interested artists to local birding hotspots and artists visit the Raptor Education Group Inc. to see the work being done to rehabilitate raptors.</p>
<p>Birds in Art was held September 8 through November 25, 2018 at the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum.</p>
<p>Birds in Art at the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum was held September 7 - December 1, 2019. </p>
<p>In 2020 the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum held Birds in Art in person for a short time and virtually.  The Wausau Bird Club was treated to an evening there with staff giving us insights into the artists methods, thoughts and frame choices.</p>
<p>The annual Birds in Art was held September 11 to November 28, 2021. Again the staff did an evening program for the Wausau Bird Club which is always very special.  An enjoyable program that the author of this renewal attended was "Murmuration" in which an artist and a reknown scientist each shared their take on the subject. </p>
<p>2022 Birds in Art was held September 10 through November 27.  Guest speaker Lauren Titers gave a presentation on "Why do Birds Sing?"  Her take on this question is that no one knows the exact answer.  The Wausau Bird Club in tandem with the Wisconsin Society of Ornithology were treated to a private tour of the exhibit.  A social was held and a bird walk the following morning.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.6, Document that your community maintains a birding trail or hot spot location with educational signage and/or literature. (Note: A birding hotspot alone is not sufficient ï¿½ your community must actively promote birding and public education at the site itself.)</strong></strong></p><p>Bitzke Bird walk maintained by the Marathon County Parks and Recreation department is a birding trail with signage. Cortney Schaefer, DNR Wildlife Biologist works with the Marathon County Forest Department on maintaining this sight.</p>
<p>In June 2022, the Wausau Bird Club promoted the Bitzke Bird Walk by conducting a bird walk at the sight.  It was well attended by a group from the the local YMCA,</p><br><br><strong>3.2.7, Document that a municipal building has significant bird-friendly landscaping that features native plants AND signage that explains the importance of native plants and providing diverse habitat for birds (e.g., brush piles, water features)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.3.1, Document a substantial regular program that educates young people on any of the following topics: climate change, energy efficiency, green/bird-safe buildings, or environmental sustainability</strong></strong></p><p>The Wausau School District which has a school forest has an exceptional environmental program for grades 4 - 8.  The focus is on environmental stewardship, awareness, wildlife, birds, forestry and "much more!"  This insight was provided in 2022.</p><br><br><strong>3.3.2, Demonstrate that schools in your community participate in a nationally recognized environmental education program (e.g., Flying WILD, Audubon Adventures) or that your community organizes its own substantial education and outreach program for young people</strong></strong></p><p>The DC Everest School District has a nature center at its school forest. Students from the district attend Flying WILD programs at Twin Oaks Environmental Center.</p>
<p>Monk Gardens and the Wausau Bird Club worked together in early June 2017 on Community Connections. This program brings elementary school children to the garden where the various activities include a nature walk, cooking in the kitchen garden, book time etc. In December 2017 children were invited to the Monk Gardens to make bird seed ornaments. This was a free activity.</p>
<p>In 2018 Monk Botanical Gardens hired an educational coordinator.  The number of nature programs for children given by her and her volunteers and interns was 140. These programs "will encourage you, your children and your family to spend time outdoors."  See scans for more details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2019 saw the Monk Botanical Gardens offer many nature programs for children.  The educational coordinator was given full-time hours to increase the number and scope of these programs.</p>
<p>In 2020 the Monk Botanical Gardens offered its weekly "Tots in the Gardens" in which the participant explores a new nature themed topic each week. The ad says "Learn about plants, birds, bugs and the tools you can use to explore nature."  Several sessions did take place prior to COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>In 2021 a Bird City Partner, the Monk Botanical Gardens established a garden and nature based preschool program for 3 - 5 year olds.  "The Sprouts program is based on high-quality early childhood education and environmental education practices, and will help lay a foundation of environmental literacy. Studies have shown that children learn best through play and hands-on experiences. Students spend at least 80% of their time outdoors, guided in exploration and learning by skilled early childhood environmental educators."  Twenty-one children were enrolled for the fall session.  The Gardens continues "Tots in the Gardens" program and its involvement with the Community Connection program.</p>
<p>In 2022 the Monk Botanical Gardens preschool enrolled 64 students in the Sprouts preschool.  The Gardens also continues its "Tots in the Gardens"  program with the issues taught were about native species and pollinators.                                                                                                                                                                                                          The second grader's in the Wausau School District curriculum focuses "solely arounds birds."  Bird habitats and adaptations are studied.  The teachers try to build a bird feeder with each student.  This information was supplied by Christopher Nelson, Environmental Education Coordinator, Wausau School Forest.  </p><br><br><strong>3.3.3, Show how your community aids a local youth group (e.g., Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of USA, 4-H Club, etc.) or conservation group in bird-conservation projects (e.g., bluebird trail, habitat restoration, Wood Duck nest boxes, etc.)</strong></strong></p><p>Two Wood Duck boxes were purchased by the Wausau Bird Club and placed in the Eau Claire River Conservancy. In the summer of 2016, 10 Bluebird houses were installed at the new soccer complex. In 2018 monitoring of all bird houses in the community continued. Repairs were made to many.  In addition, the Wausau Bird Club cut out 30 nest boxes: 10 Bluebird, 10 Chickadee/House Wren and 10 Wood Duck.  The club met with Cub Scout Pack 439 to assemble the boxes.  A presentation was given to explain the value of nesting boxes and to introduce the species the boxes might attract to the group. Each boy got to choose either a Wren box or Bluebird house to install in their yard. Some of the Wood Duck houses were placed in appropriate locations in the area.</p>
<p>In 2019 in the Blue Gill Bay county park the Parks Department worked with an Eagle Scout. The Scout maintained sections of trail and put up signage. This park is regularly used by the Wausau Bird Club for meetings and walks.</p>
<p>In early 2020 the Wausau Bird Club was asked by a DC Everest middle school science teacher about having his students get involved in monitoring blue bird houses. The club constructed 6 houses but unfortunately the students were not able to install last spring. The teacher and others did install the poles that the club provided with hopes that this spring his curriculum will focus on installing the houses and learning all about monitoring and the lives of eastern blue birds.  The club also provided educational material for use in the classroom.</p>
<p>In 2021 the DC Everest students "really enjoyed going out to check the bluebird houses" according to the teacher in charge of the project.  Additionally he reports that one boy came to him and wants to start an after school club for bird watching and to set up feeders to attract more birds to the school grounds.  The Wausau Bird Club said to let them know how we can help establish this club.</p>
<p>In May of 2022, Jim Peck a member of the Wausau Bird Club assisted scouts of BSA Troop 409 in completing their Bird Study Merit Badge.  The scouts used the binoculars purchased by the Bird Club to visually identify birds.  Along with the visual their also learned about sound identification.  Study included learning about bird's role in the environment and how to create habitat by the planting of native trees and shrubs.</p><br><br><strong>3.3.4, Show that your municipality promotes and supports a bird club or other environmentally/ecologically minded club. (Exclusions: garden clubs, unless you demonstrate a strong focus on native plants)</strong></strong></p><p>The Wausau Bird Club celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2017.</p>
<p>In 2019 the Wausau Bird Club continues to receive support from local government.</p>
<p>2020 again saw the Wausau Bird Club continued its working relationship with the City of Wausau and the Marathon County.</p>
<p>Wausau Bird Club continued to be an asset to the community in 2021.</p>
<p>Wausau Marathon County Park and Recreation values the work of the Wausau Bird Club at Barker-Stewart Island.  Also many community partners including the club came together to work on the GPHW which was designated a State of Wisconsin Waterway</p>
<p> </p><br><br><strong>3.4.1, Show that your community works with traditionally underserved communities to increase their access to natural areas, environmental education, birding resources, and local environmental experts</strong></strong></p><p>In 2018, the educational coordinator at Monk Botanical Gardens instituted environmental programs at the Boys and Girls of Wausau.  The Gardens also educated through Community Connections which is run by the Wausau School District.  According to Community Connections data collected 22 - 59% of participants receive free or reduced lunches.</p>
<p>Monk Botanical Garden's educational coordinator reported that 1431 underserved children attended the programs provided there.  30 hours of programs were given to the Boys and Girls Club of Wausau.  In addition a program entitled "Springtime Birding with Lori" was sponsored by the United Way and free to the public.  In addition, a program called Trail Tales was implemented.  A children's books entitled "Jump Frog, Jump!" and "I Don't Want to be a Frog" were enlarged and placed along the River Edge trail.  The idea of the trail is to encourage kids to read aloud the story as they enjoy the nature around them and learn about the creatures that make up nature.</p>
<p>Monk Botanical Gardens continues its work in 2020 with underserved groups.  They partnered with Marathon County Head Start to provide six half-day field trips to 2 of the classrooms providing environmental education. </p>
<p>Summer of 2021 saw the Wausau Bird Club undertake a large program for Community Connections.  In partnership with the local Wild Birds Unlimited 10 pair of child size binoculars were purchased from Vortex.  Members of the club went to 5 elementary schools for an afternoon and taught the kids how to use them to spot birds.  A test was devised to determine if they were looking through the binoculars or just guessing.  Most all passed.  The club also did additional teaching on migration perils, habitat, bird feeding and bird identification.  Monk Gardenins continues to work with Head Start students by taking them on field trips through the gardens.  Staff pointed out the bluebird houses. found nests. discussed migration and our winters and observed birds at the feeders.  The Trail Tales program continued in 2021.</p>
<p>Julie Bollmann,<strong><strong> Out-of-School</strong></strong> Program Coordinator, for the Wausau School District reported that an after school program targets Title I schools students.  The after school activies include outdoor and bird awareness. The partners in these activities are Monk Botanical Gardens, Snapshot Science and Woodson Art Museum {which Julie says "has a huge bird focus}.  There are various outdoor clubs at the schools.  The percentage varies from school to school but ranges from 38% to 70% of the free and reduced lunch marker.</p><br><br><strong>3.5.1, Illustrate a program that involves schools, garden clubs, or other organizations in bird-conservation activities</strong></strong></p><p>Wausau Bird Club and their partner Monk Botanical Gardens worked together on multiple programs in 2017 involving school groups and the community.  One program in July 2017 was StoryWalk held at the Monk Gardens.  Wausau Bird Club sponsored a book called <em>Spit and Sticks:  A Chimney Full of Swifts.  </em>The books are put on stakes and the families walk through the gardens to read the book.  Our book ended in front of our Chimney Swift tower.  Members of the club were on hand to explain the tower and its value to the bird.</p>
<p>Monk Botanical Gardens educational coordinator ran many programs in the Wausau School District to acquaint children on conservation methods.</p>
<p>The Monk Botanical Gardens continued with its nature programs for children in 2019.  Garden Visions continues to offer workshops on conserving bird habitats.  This year "Creating a Bird-Friendly Garden was given with emphasis on making decisions in the garden that benefit birds.  Each year the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum continues to offer programs during the Birds in Art display on bird conservation.  This year "Bird Conservation in Your Own Backyard" was given by Craig Thompson, WBCI member.</p>
<p>In December of 2022 the Wausau Bird Club was asked to be involved with Thomas Jefferson Grade School in Wausau.  They were holding an event featuring birds.  The day of the event was extremely cold holding down attendance but all who came had a great experience.  REGI had live birds, the kids used the binoculars bought by the Club during a scavenger hunt and the Club had a bird feeder for the kids to make.  But because of the cold it became a take-home feeder.  Games about migration and matching a bird's bill to its food were given out as well.  Refreshments were on hand as well.  It was a great event.  One father told the Club members present that his son was now learning the scientific names of the birds!</p><br><br><strong>3.6.1, Demonstrate that your community is represented in at least one citizen science bird-monitoring program (e.g., the Christmas Bird Count, Great Backyard Bird Count, Swift Night Out)</strong></strong></p><p>The Wausau Bird Club has participated in the Christmas Bird Count since 1950. The club also annually conducts a Spring Count that traditionally has been held on the second Saturday of May as part of the club's celebration of International Migratory Bird Day. Members of the community also participate in the Great Backyard Bird Count. Local birders also have been active in citizen science by conducting a Marsh Bird survey in 9 Mile County Forest, participating in a Red-shouldered Hawk survey in Marathon County and in a breeding bird survey also conducted in the 9 Mile County Forest.</p>
<p>In 2016, members of the community and the Wausau Bird Club participated in the following count activities:</p>
<p>Great Backyard Bird Count</p>
<p>Spring Migration Count</p>
<p>Swift Night Out</p>
<p>Christmas Bird Count</p>
<p>Breeding Bird Atlas II</p>
<p>Residents again participated in all of the above counts in 2017.</p>
<p>2018 once again found Wausau residents and the Wausau Bird Club involved in all of the above bird surveys. In addition a Cerulean Warbler survey was conducted at the Nine Mile County Forest.</p>
<p>2019 was a busy year with the Wausau Bird Club's members and community members participating in all of the programs listed above.</p>
<p>Even with COVID, the Wausau Bird Club participated in all of the counts above except the Breeding Bird Atlas which has ended.</p>
<p>In 2021 members of the Wausau Bird Club participated in the Christmas Bird Count, Spring Migration Count, Swift Night Out and the Great Backyard Bird Count.  Many members did all 4!  2021 was the 70th year that the Wausau Bird Club participated in the Christmas Bird Count unfortunately members felt uneasy about having a party to celebrate.  Maybe in 2022!</p>
<p>2022 saw the members of the Wausau Bird club join in counting birds in the area.  The Christmas Bird Count, Spring Migration Count, the Great Backyard Bird Count, Feeder Watch and Swift Night Out all have member participation.  We ended the Swift Night Out with meeting at Culver's to discuss our sightings.  This has become a tradition.</p><br><br><strong>3.6.2, Attach results from organized bird monitoring or data obtained from researchers or volunteers in the local park system. (Exclusions: programs that receive credit under 4C: Christmas Bird Count, Great Backyard Bird Count, Swift Night Out)</strong></strong></p><p>Wausau Bird Club members meet monthly at various city and county parks during the summer. A walk is held and bird species are noted and counted. The city parks include Fern Island, Blue Gill Bay and Dells of the Eau Claire County Park. A DNR Marsh Bird Survey is conducted annually at Nine Mile County Recreational Area.  In 2017 the club met at Garske Park in addition to a walk at Blue Gill Bay Park to confirm a White-eyed Vireo seen earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Once again in 2018 Wausau Bird Club held walks at area parks and results were submitted to ebird.  A DNR marsh bird survey was conducted at 9-Mile County forest. At the Eastbay Soccer complex the 10 Bluebird houses were again monitored and data submitted.</p>
<p>In 2019 Wausau Bird Club members participated in the last year of the Breeding Bird Atlas. Results of the club's walks at area parks were submitted to ebird. The marsh bird survey was again conducted and the bluebird houses were monitored as well.</p>
<p>In 2020 members of the Wausau Bird Club were forced to hold fewer walks but the few we did hold were submitted to ebird. Our blue bird houses continue to be monitored and results submitted.  </p>
<p>The Wausau Bird Club again reported in 2021 the results of our meetings held in local parks to ebird.  And all of the numerous bird houses erected at local parks were cleaned and monitored   Two members of the Wausau Bird Club participate in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Spring Woodcock Singing-Ground survey.  The routes are in Marathon County.  In addition they are part of the DNR's Woodcock Spring Banding program.</p>
<p>In 2022 the Wausau Bird Club held over 9 bird watching events in the community parks and even on Lake Wausau.  The sightings at all of these were entered into ebird to contribute to citizen science.</p><br><br><strong>3.7.1, Resolution: Attach a copy of your community's officially enacted resolution.

<p>This new committee is comprised of city officials and citizens. </p>
<p>In 2020 the City of Wausau's sustainability, energy and environment committee started a recognition program for businesses and organizations that make admirable use of alternative energy or use sustainable practices.</p>
<p>The City of Wausau's Sustainability, Energy and Environment committee (SEEC) in 2022 is drafting a resolution supporting the reduction of greenhouse emmissions.  If the resolution is passed by Wausau's common council SEEC hope to enroll in Wisconsin Local Government Climate Coalition (WLGCC).  The WLGCC is a group focused on climate change and making sure local governments are heard. They have provided comments on state legislative proceedings and wish to engage more local governments. The group has targeted funding identifed to support their mission and assist local governments in the transition to clean energy. They may even be able to help Wausau develop a Carbon Action Plan. There is no cost to the city to join.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Former alderman and Wausau Bird Club member, Pat Peckman stated that The Community Development Office has a provision usually added to proposals for new building projects.  The proposals are scored and (usually) would get 10 extra points for any GREEN element such as solar that would be incorporated into the new construction.  The higher the score the better the chance of approval.                                        </p><br><br><strong>4.2.2, Show that your community has implemented a sustainability plan that improves your community's energy efficiency and/or increases the use of renewable energy.

<p>Wausau also has the River Edge Master Plan which will eventually connect a system of trails along the Wisconsin River to all other neighbors and business districts.  <a href="http://www.ci.wausau.wi.us/Portals/0/Departments/Planning/Documents/remp.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.ci.wausau.wi.us/Portals/0/Departments/Planning/Documents/remp.pdf</a> </p>

<p>Wausau has received a grant in 2019 to implement a bike share system. Ten bikes will be available year round and located in two stations in Riverlife.  Additional funding is being sought to expand the program.</p>
<p>In 2020 Alderman Pat Peckham advised that the City of Wausau improved the River Edge Trail to enhance connectivity of the West Side to the East Side of the Wisconsin River in downtown Wausau.  It will now be more valuable to bicycle commuters.  An update to the River Edge Master Plan in 2020 is "setting the direction for the River Edge Trail system in the future and strategize on hard-to-complete segments."</p>
<p>In 2021 two new segments of the River Edge Trail now called River Edge Parkway were added in 2021.  One segment is on the west side of the Wisconsin River and is not yet conencted to the rest of the trail except by road.  The second segment continues the trail further north.  The Wausau City Development office hopes these additions will bring new businesses to the area.</p>
