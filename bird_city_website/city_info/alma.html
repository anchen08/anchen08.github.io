He believed the raptors would visit the stacks (which are several hundred feet high) at one of Dairyland’s power plants, located between high bluffs and the Mississippi River … the perfect spot for a falcon family.  Anderson speculated the raptors might find a nest box high on one of the stacks an appealing place to call home. Dairyland management was enthusiastic and a raptor neighborhood was born.  The first falcon nest box was established in Alma in 1994 and on Earth Day 1997 the first pair of breeding peregrine falcons moved in, raising 3 chicks.  The nest box was remodeled in 1991 to provide more perch space.</p>
