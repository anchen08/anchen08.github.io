The MCP’s Natural Areas Program manages 10,275 acres within the Milwaukee County Park System. In order to efficiently and effectively manage the natural areas within the Park System, from both a social and ecological standpoint, the MCP began developing and implementing Ecological Restoration &amp; Management Plans for these natural areas. These planning documents act as a comprehensive guide for how each natural area should be managed over the course of a 10-year timeframe. A major component of these plans is focused on creating and improving habitat for breeding and migratory wildlife. Examples of these habitat improvements include: reforestation of turf grass/agricultural fields, invasive species removal, installation of pollinator gardens, and seeding native plants into restoration areas. This restoration and management planning process has also been incorporated into SEWRPC Watershed Management Plans, the County’s Land and Water Resource Plan, and the MCP’s internal decision making process. Several recent projects include: 15-acres of reforeataion along the Root River in 2021,19-acres of reforestation at Barloga Woods in 2019-2020, 10-acres of reforestation projects at Brown Deer and Falk Parks in 2018 (focusing on native tree/shrub species beneficial to migratory birds), 0.7-acre wet-prairie planting at Greenfield Park in 2017, and the removal of invasive species populations which improves an average of 800 acres of bird habitat each year. Finally, the MCP acquired an additional 11 acres of critical natural areas in 2021.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The Milwaukee River Greenway Coalition (UEC, RRF, River Keeper, Bike Federation of WI, Milwaukee Environmental Consortium, Milwaukee County, and the Village of Shorewood) played an active role in convincing the City of Milwaukee to create and approve a Tree Protection ordinance (File #081570) that states "This ordinance prohibits, with limited exceptions, any person from removing, damaging, disturbing or otherwise destroying any living and structurally sound tree located within the primary environmental corridor in the Milwaukee River greenway site plan overlay zone unless the person has obtained a tree maintenance and conservation permit from the commissioner of public works. This ordinance also establishes various requirements that apply to all tree maintenance and conservation permits issued by the commissioner, including a requirement for the replacement of removed trees, with a preference for native species, and the prohibition of any tree removal or disturbance that would result in soil erosion or slope destabilization."</p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong></strong></p><p>The MCP regularly undertakes projects to provide vital habitat for pollinators. MCP in partnership the Xerces Society, hosted a rusty patched bumble bee habitat management workshop with area land managers in 2019. One of the outcomes of this workshop was the further development of the MCP's new bumble monitoring community science program. Community Science bee volunteers donated 630 hours conducting surveys in 2020. To date the monitoring has documented the federally endangered rusty patch bumble bee in 16 parks within the park system. Also, in recent years MCP has planted 61 acres of native prairie plants focusing on planting a diversity of plants that bloom spring through fall. The MCP has installed a bee pod at Dretzka Golf Course as part of its Audubon certification and maintains a beehive at Wehr Nature Center for educational programming with area schools. The MCP and its partner organizations have also planted pollinator gardens, rain gardens, or micro-prairies at parks (Grant, Nash, Riverside, Warnimont,Washington, Whitnall, Greenfield, Juneau, Lake, Doctors, and Kletzsch) throughout the system. To date,11 species of bumble bees have been documented using natural areas within the park system. </p><br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community.

The MCP’s Dretzka Golf Course has received the Audubon golf course certification. Staff are currently removing invasive species, monitoring wildlife populations, planting native plants for pollinators, conducting youth education events, testing water quality at the golf course as part of the certification process, and recently installed a bee pod/hive.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong></strong></p><p>Numerous utility (power, gas, water, sewer, stormwater, etc.) ROW easements cross the MCP Park System. Before utility easement holders can enter and conduct work within these easements they are required to provide documentation clearly showing all proposed activities and potential impacts. They are required to provide an invasive species management plan listing how equipment will be cleaned before and after accessing sites as to prevent the introduction of invasive species, provide a list of what herbicides will be used and the application rates, and provide a list of what materials will used for restoration work. When restoring the vegetation at a site contractors are required to use natural fiber erosion control mats (nylons fibers can cause wildlife mortality), plant MCP approved seed mixes most of which are native species, control any MCP rapid response invasive species within the utility corridor, and work during conditions that do not cause rutting or soil erosion. All of these requirements are collated in MCP Right-of-Entry permits that must be issued before any work can be undertaken in a ROW running through MCP property.  In certain circumstances, typically stormwater or drainage easements, the MCP requires a tree inventory and compensation to the tree replacement fund for any trees removed, and it also requires an inventory of rare native plants which need to be avoided during construction. MCP also placed a vegetation mowing moritorium on ROW clearance during the bird nesting season. </p></p>

Habitat within the Park System is protected under County ordinance 47.08, which prohibits the “Injury to, destruction, or removal of public property.” Furthermore, Parks staff have worked with all the local municipalities in Milwaukee County to make sure all parkland is zoned as parkland. This designation prevents the sale of zoned parkland unless both the County Executive and the County Board of Supervisors agree on the sale.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong></strong></p><p>The MCP Natural Areas staff, volunteers, and partner organizations work to improve the ecology of approximately 800 acres of habitat each year through it natural areas activities. In the past 11 years the MCP has planted 48-acres of prairie at Bender Park, reforested approximately 79-acres of turf grass and agricultural fields system-wide, planted a 1-acre prairie at Grant Park (2015), 11-acres of prairie planted at Franklin Savanna, 23 acres of woodland understory plantings since 2016, and planted approximately 6-acres of pollinator gardens and native plant buffers along Park System lagoons and river ways in 12 parks.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong></strong></p><p>The MCP has an active urban forestry program that is planting native hardwoods trees within the Park System. A significant part of this work has recently focused on replacing native ash trees, because EAB has caused a severe decline in forest cover. As previously noted in this application, the Natural Areas staff has also planted native trees and shrubs beneficial to birds as part of the MCP’s turf grass and agricultural land conversion program. In the last 6-years the Natural Areas Program has planted approximately 8,400 native trees and shrubs as part of the Natural Areas/Parks reforestation program. </p><br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

From 2009-2020, the Natural Areas Program and its partners trained over 20,000 volunteers who donated nearly 130,000 hours towards restoration and management of the Park System’s natural resources. The MCP works with local middle and high schools, colleges and universities, private corporations, and not-for-profit organizations to provide hands-on field-based education on invasive species identification and management throughout the Park System. Critical partners such as The Park People and their “Weed-Out!” program provide numerous opportunities for the public to become involved with invasive species removal within the Park System’s natural areas under the guidance of the Natural Areas Program. The MCP has taken a leadership role (past President and past Secretary) within the Southeastern Wisconsin Invasive Species Consortium, which acts as an education and resource based Cooperative Weed Management Area for southeastern Wisconsin. Lastly, the Wehr Nature Center, which is part of the Milwaukee County Park System, provides programming for the public that engages them in invasive species education and management. The MCP is also incredibly fortunate to have numerous additional partners such as the TNC, UEC, RRF, and HTF that work on MCP property with their volunteers undertaking invasive species removal and native plant restoration projects. </p><br><br><strong>1.4.2, Demonstrate that your community offers a program for private property owners who are interested in dealing with invasive plants that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Wehr Nature Center and Schlitz Audubon both offer Master Naturalist programs that educate private citizens on land management techniques.

This silo was scheduled for removal in 2018, however Natural Areas staff successfully advocated that the silo not be removed as long at it is structurally sound. The silo has since been removed from the demolition list. The MCP also has additional small Chimney Swift nesting colonies in the chimneys of three historic buildings in the Park System. Natural Areas staff advocated for any future repair or maintenance work on these chimneys only be conducted during the non-breeding season in order to protect the nesting Chimney Swifts.</p><br><br><strong>1.6.2, Document the establishment of a program to promote the conservation of Purple Martins through research, state-of-the-art management techniques, or public education</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.1.1, Describe your community's educational program to control free-roaming cats and/or the manner in which you actively publicize the Cats Indoors initiative</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.1.2, Document a program that effectively reduces feral cat populations (Note: See 3F for enforced ordinances).

As part of the process, staff and volunteers assessed 67 buildings within the park system, and surveyed the 13 highest ranking (for potential mortality) in 2020. During the surveys the Currie GC clubhouse window's were determined to be killing the largest number of birds. Staff started window strike mitigation by placing Feather Friendly dots on the windows in 2021. The mitigation work will be finished in 2022, at which point staff will start mitigating the windows at the Brown Deer Park Boathouse.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee County Zoo staff and volunteers work hard to minimize injury and mortality associated with bird window collisions. Existing structures are actively monitored and modified to help mitigate strikes. By applying stencils, striping, silhouettes, decals, netting and better planting practices, bird window collisions are greatly reduced and can be used as an educational tool with zoo visitors. Additionally, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee conducts a study to document window collisions on campus. The Wehr Nature Center also installed bird friendly windows in its recent renovation of the center’s education room, which has reduced the significant number of collisions to nearly zero collisions after window installation, and this allows education staff to discuss bird mortality and window strikes with the thousands of visitors and school children that use the nature center each year.</p><br><br><strong>2.2.2, Demonstrate that your community has enacted a bird collision monitoring program and has treated problem windows to reduce collisions with municipal and commercial buildings</strong></strong></p><p>See description in 3B</p></p>

The guide also highlights non-herbicide treatments, if possible, such as mowing, hand pulling, and bio-control whilie clearly listing the windows for effective control. The Natural Areas Program has also partnered with schools and universities to raise and release purple loosestrife beetles as bio-control in the past. As mentioned in category #1 Natural Areas staff is currently digitally mapping all invasive species populations within the Park System. One of the goals and implemented actions of this inventory is to find and remove "rapid response" populations of invasives such as, Japanese barberry, Japanese knotweed, lesser celandine, European privet, wayfaring tree, etc., that are not yet common in the Park System. By controlling these species at low population levels, staff can prevent them from becoming the next common buckthorn or garlic mustard and greatly reduce future herbicide use. MCP also created its first system-wide <a href="https://mkecoparks.helpscoutdocs.com/article/82-do-you-use-pesticides-in-the-parks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">integrated pest management plan</a> in 2019.</p><br><br><strong>3.1.1, Document and describe your event that incorporates the annual WMBD theme in some fashion.
