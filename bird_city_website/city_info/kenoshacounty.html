The project aimed to improve water quality and improve local aquatic and bird habitat with the planting of native vegetation. Additionally, 3.9 acres of the wetland was restored at the site. The project is outlined in the<a href="http://www.rootpikewin.org/pike-river-plan" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> EPA-approved Nine Key Element Plan</a> for the Pike River Watershed. Restoration of the site has resulted in an increase in bird counts within the riparian habitat. </p>
<p>In 2021, Kenosha County completed <a href="https://www.kenoshanews.com/news/local/ribbon-cutting-ceremony-friday-to-mark-completion-of-pike-river-phase-ii-restoration-project/article_63ac8f00-dc4a-5ab0-b9b2-bcc8b3e4401d.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase II</a> of this project within Petrifying Springs Park. An additional 4.83 acres of riparian habitat and 3,280 linear feet of streambank was restored in this project site. Native vegetation aimed at improving local wildlife habitat was installed within the project site. This will expand opportunities to attract native birds back to the site.  </p>
<p>In Spring 2021, Kenosha County planted 100 oak trees within Kenosha County Veterans Memorial Park, partially funded through a grant the American Transmission Co.’s Community Planting Program.The oak savanna project focused on introducing native oak trees within approximately 43 acres of the eastern portion of the park. Oak savanna habitats provide outstanding conditions for a variety of wildlife. Oak trees provide nesting sites for birds as well as food for insects.
