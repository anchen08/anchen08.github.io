<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Plymouth contains many recreational parks that provide excellent habitat for many bird species. Most of the parks contain several different species trees and shrubs. Plymouth’s “Smart Growth” plan, <em>City of Plymouth Comprehensive Plan</em>, discusses the importance of developing neighborhoods to take advantage of the environmental corridors found within the City. It states that future neighborhood park sites would be appropriate along these corridors thus providing more bird habitat within the City.</p>
<p>Birds are an important of any community, and Plymouth has provided protected habitats specifically for birds and are expanding such habitats throughout Plymouth. Much of the wooded area around the Mullet River and several of our parks have designated bird habitats. H.M. Meyer Nature Park (300 Daleview Drive) is a 25 acre park located in the southwest portion of the city, adjacent to the Mullet River. This park has undergone renovation to restore the land. The dam was removed, restoring the meandering Mullet River that flowed naturally through the area. Extensive wildflowers and plants have prospered, making a great natural habitat for birds.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Plymouth continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1993.
