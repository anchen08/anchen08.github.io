<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The City of La Crosse’s website states:</p>
<p>The 1999-2001 Wisconsin Biennial budget included legislation requiring all Cities, Villages, and Towns to adopt comprehensive plans by 2010. Under the Comprehensive Planning and “Smart Growth” Legislation all jurisdictions will prepare and adopt a comprehensive plan with at least nine elements. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2010, any community that makes land-use decisions is required to base those decisions on its adopted comprehensive plan. Each element of the plan will include background information, objectives, polices and goals, programs, and a portrayal of what those aspects of the community are planned to look like when the target year arrives (2020 for the La Crosse Comprehensive Plan).</p>
<p>Not only does La Crosse meet the nine elements that are required by state law, but it added an additional five elements to its comprehensive plan.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Since 2002, the La Crosse has been in partnership with the Mississippi Valley Conservancy (MVC) to purchase and preserve the local bluff lands through the La Crosse Bluffland Protection Project. According to the Mississippi Valley Conservancy website, “The program provides scenic preservation to ensure that beauty of the landscape is not destroyed by poorly-planned development, as well as protecting rare natural communities like bluff prairies and providing a marvelous outdoor recreational resource.”<em> </em>An indirect effect of this conservation effort is that it enlarges the habitat for local and migratory birds.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>La Crosse has a longstanding tradition of promoting effective and responsible land use. This point can be demonstrated by the volume of natural habitat for local wildlife that surrounds the city. The City continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1989.</p></p>
