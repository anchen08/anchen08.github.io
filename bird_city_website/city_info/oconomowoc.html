<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>Five years prior to the Wisconsin Legislature enacting a comprehensive planning law in 1999, which is set forth in Section 66.1001 of the Wisconsin Statutes, the City of Oconomowoc adopted a Comprehensive Plan. The City plan addresses all nine of the key elements identified by Smart Growth Legislation. Several components, including protecting wetlands, a commitment to preserving, protecting, and expanding the natural resources of the area, protecting groundwater recharge areas, working in cooperation with neighboring municipalities, county and State agencies, and implementing a systematic review of all appropriate ordinances including: Zoning, Subdivision, Sign, Parking, Landscaping, Floodplain, Wetland Ordinances, etc. to ensure consistency with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, assures that the City of Oconomowoc plans its growth with birds and other wildlife in mind. The City is careful to maintain the shoreline landscaping so it is appropriate for wildlife while it impedes erosion as well as landscaping which is beneficial to our ecosystem. Since this original adoption of the Oconomowoc Comprehensive Plan the City has amended and adopted a plan in 2010 that extends to the year 2030.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Oconomowoc does not restrict natural or “wild” landscapes as long as the landscapes are maintained.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Oconomowoc continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in April, 1993. The City of Oconomowoc is proud to say that they have over 6,000 trees that the Parks and Forestry Department maintains, with an average of over 200 additional trees being planted every year. Every year we hold our Arbor Day Celebration at one of the schools in the District.  The City selects a school each year to celebrate with. Students study Arbor Day and trees' importance leading up to an all-school celebration. At that celebration we share why trees are important, including that they are great habitats for birds. We also donate a tree to be planted on the school grounds.  The City was unable to do this in 2020 due to school restrictions.  The City is hopeful to be able to continue the Arbor Day Celebrations in 2021.  In 2018, the City of Oconomowoc was awarded the Growth Award by Tree CIty USA.</p></p>

<h4>Limiting or Removing Threats to Birds</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection. (Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>In 1999, the City of Oconomowoc adopted a 30 year Comprehensive Plan to guide all land use activities until the year 2030. This extensive document ensures that planning occurs with bird habitat and open space in mind. The Park and Open Space Plan is intended to provide for areas where recreational needs can be met without undue disturbance of natural areas. Examples of areas like this in Oconomowoc are the pedestrian and bike path that runs from Roosevelt Park to Sawyer Road as well as the many lakes in and around the city. Oconomowoc also has very strict ordinances regarding the planting and maintenance of trees, especially in public areas. Ordinance 8A.08 PLANTING OF TREES AND SHRUBS states: "The Common Council hereby states its determination that the planting, care and protection of the trees within the City is desirable for the purposes of beauty, shade, comfort, noise abatement, air quality enhancement and economic betterment and hereby encourages all persons to assist in a program of tree planting, care and protection" as well as creating a welcoming environment for birds.</p>
<p>Several years ago, the Parks and Forestry Department installed Purple Martin houses in two of the parks. The houses were all replaced with new houses in 2017. In 2015, the Parks and Forestry Department worked cooperatively with the Oconomowoc High School to install approximately 20 Bluebird houses along the Lake Country Recreational Trail. The Parks and Forestry Department established a cooperative agreement to monitor and maintain these houses. The Parks and Forestry Department will continuously maintain the Bluebird houses for many years to come.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Parks, Recreation and Forestry Department planted shrubbery in the landscaping beds in the city’s downtown roundabout. Every year the Parks and Forestry Department plants annuals in the city’s downtown roundabout and in flowerbeds lining the downtown. The annuals attract many birds. In 2016, new shrubs were planted in Veterans Memorial Park that will provide a nesting area for birds. The City built a new Community Center in 2013. The Parks and Forestry Department continues to improve landscaping including planting new trees every year and in 2016 constructing perennial flower beds. These flower beds will provide seeds for the birds to eat and the flowers will provide nectar to attract insects that birds eat.</p>
<p>On average, the City plants 200 or more trees annually to increase potential bird habitat as part of its urban forestry program. In 2019, The Parks and Forestry Department planted over 200 trees within the city!  In 2016, the City Horticulturist designed a landscape plan for the lawn area between the Community Center and Lac La Belle. We have many wedding ceremonies and needed the area cleaned up to make it look nicer for this. Also, the new plantings will increase bird habitats and attract insects that will attract more birds to the area. We continue to add annuals to this area every year.  In 2017, the Village Green and the Library both had new landscaping put in.  The Parks and Forestry Department put in many new plantings that are bird friendly and inviting.  In 2018, the Parks and Forestry Department added to the landscaping at Village Green and revamped the entire boardwalk and boat launch area, adding many new landscaping beds to include annuals and perennials to attract many insects and birds to the area.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids. (Recommendations for SE WI)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.5, Attach a copy of a local ordinance to demonstrate that your community does not restrict natural/native landscaping that emphasizes native plants and non-turf lawns</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.4.1, Show that your community offers the public information on how they can control and remove invasive species in order to improve or maintain bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>On the <a href="http://www.oconomowoc-wi.gov/index.aspx?NID=333" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Parks, Recreation and Forestry website</a>, there is a listing of the worst invasive Wisconsin plants such as Reed Canary Grass. In the department office, they have brochures available to the public on Zebra Mussels, Buckthorn, and Garlic Mustard.</p>
<p>The Parks and Forestry staff removed buckthorn in 2018 to improve the urban forest and replaced it with trees and shrubbery that is conducive to bird habitat in Bub Heritage Park and they continue to maintain this area.</p></p>

Oconomowoc's Bird City<a href="https://www.oconomowoc-wi.gov/792/Bird-City-Resources" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> website</a> has a link to the American Bird Conservancy's collisions program which has comprehensive information regarding why birds collide with glass, the most effective ways to prevent window strikes, what doesn’t work and what to do with a stunned bird. <a href="http://www.abcbirds.org/abcprograms/policy/collisions/pdf/collisions_flyer.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">An informative brochure</a> on preventing window strikes comes from the American Bird Conservancy. Oconomowoc also has information posted on its <a href="https://www.oconomowoc-wi.gov/792/Bird-City-Resources" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> about collisions with wind turbines and also shares information about the dangers of power lines and tall towers such as communication towers.</p>
<p>The Parks, Recreation and Forestry Department received an email from a tutor and her middle school student with positive feedback on our City of Oconomowoc website.  They tutor wanted to say thanks...the student was working on a project on birds and migration, and was doing research and ended up on our department's <a href="https://www.oconomowoc-wi.gov/792/Bird-City-Resources" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bird City page</a> on the City of Oconomowoc website. The student found some excellent info for the project there! The student and tutor also gave us another good birding resource - "<a href="https://www.improvenet.com/a/the-young-birder-backyard-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Young Birder's Backyard Guide</a>".  The City of Oconomowoc has since added this to the webpage.  The resource has some great basic birding &amp; ornithology info for kids and beginners.</p></p>
