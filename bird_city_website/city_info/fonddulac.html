<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p> The City of Fond du Lac has demonstrated that it has continued to comply with the state of Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” law for land use and planning and resource management. Its “Comprehensive Plan 2010-2030” was adopted on 10/14/09.  The City's Community Development Department has updated this plan creating the “2040 Comprehensive Plan”. This plan was adoption by City Council on 1/27/21. Natural resources was again a focus in the updated plan.  More specifically, the Ag, Natural &amp; Cultural Resources chapter acknowledged local efforts in community gardens, community-supported agriculture, native landscaping, and taking a proactive approach to floodplain mitigation.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Plans for several City parks will protect or enhance bird habitat.</p>
<p>The McDermott Park master plan includes walking trails, landscaped areas and gathering spaces in this large City Park.  The park is bordered by DeNeveu Cr., along which evergreen trees and vegetated creek banks provide wildlife habitat.  The City completed, with help from a DNR Stewardship grant, a bike/pedestrian trail through the center of the Park in 2020. Trees and benches were added in 2022. In 2023, the City will be adding landscape areas and gathering places found in the master plan.</p>
<p>Lakeside Park provides a large expanse of shoreline on the southern end of Lake Winnebago. In the winter months the wastewater treatment outfall provides excellent birding and is a favorite of local birders. Lighthouse Drive is being reconstructed in spring 2023 and while removing some existing trees is necessary for the project (due to adding a safer bike and pedestrian trail), the City will replant more trees and shrubbery than what is existing.</p>
<p>Lakeside Park West is a large expanse of parkland almost completely undeveloped, west of the Fond du Lac River. A boardwalk into the marsh and viewing platform was complete in winter 2023. These will be great additions for bird viewing. A bird walk is planned for this park during the 2023 WMBD celebration. A new bike and pedestrian bridge will be built over the Fond du Lac River in 2023 that will connect this park with Lakeside Park. This will create additional access to birding sites in both parks. Landscaping will be added to these two projects if budget allows or in future years.</p>
<p>Cardinal Park had walking trails constructed in 2022 and trees were also planted.</p>
<p>The Living Well Coalition is watching to see how fruit trees and community gardens in Hamilton Park, Franklin Park, and the local YMCA start to produce, not only so these fresh foods can be made available to the community in these "food deserts," but also to be able to tell and show other interested parties what can come from these trees and food plots.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Fond du Lac continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1988.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong></strong></p><p>John Redmond, Parks &amp; Forestry Superintendent, graduated from CTMI in 2016, and attended the "alumni" program in 2017.</p></p>

In our parks, we added 40 new trees in 2022, including one in Lakeside Park for our Arbor Day celebration. In additions, we planted 550 terrace trees in 2022. Most of them replaced locations of ash trees but some were added to relatively recent subdivisions (15-20 years old) that did not have any terrace trees. Overall, we used about 70% native species.</p>

(Exceptions: invasive species control and public safety)</strong></strong></p><p>The City's Public Works Department bought a mini-excavator and brush mower attachment in late 2019 that will allow it to complete needed ditch and pond maintenance more efficiently and effectively. 2020 was the first year we were able to avoid this work during the May 15 to July 15 time period to avoid bird nests. This will also free up the seasonal employees who conduct this work to complete other duties.  </p><br><br><strong>1.5.2, Implement a tree-risk policy that includes specific plans to leave dead trees standing as nesting and foraging resources for birds when it is safe to do so (follow Urban Tree Risk Management, especially pg. 153)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.6.1, Demonstrate the implementation of a program to preserve Chimney Swift nesting and roosting sites (preferred) and/or to construct Chimney Swift towers</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.6.2, Document the establishment of a program to promote the conservation of Purple Martins through research, state-of-the-art management techniques, or public education</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.1.1, Describe your community's educational program to control free-roaming cats and/or the manner in which you actively publicize the Cats Indoors initiative</strong></strong></p><p>The City has an ordinance (216-16, 216-17, and 216-18) prohibiting dogs and cats running at large, and requiring their owners to restrain them. The local chapter of the Audubon Society has been distributing a pamphlet entitled “Cats, Birds and You” at their public meetings and multiple community events where they set up their booth.
