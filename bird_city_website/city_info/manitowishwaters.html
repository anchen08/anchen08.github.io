The professionally made, metal signs are in color, and set on 4-foot cedar posts. The signs are distributed strategically throughout the trail system in habitat typically used by the birds depicted. Each sign gives specific information about one to two species. The information includes: key identification characteristics; song and call traits; facts about their life history; and a North American map displaying the bird’s annual distribution with breeding, migration and wintering areas; and GPS quadrants. A leaflet is available at the start of the trail, giving information on the location of the bird signs. The signs are maintained and periodically replaced by the NLDC Bird Club.

This station provides training opportunities for volunteers interested in bird banding and provides free public demonstration on a monthly basis. This station collaborates with the Northwoods Wildlife Center to study survival of post-rehabilitation of passerines and is working towards becoming a long-term monitoring station through the MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship) Program.</p>
<p>Each year in mid-April, the Discovery Center’s Bird Club and Manitowish Waters community members participate in the Annual Midwest Crane Count.
