This is an annual on-going event at this premier nature conservancy, and continues to build high-quality bird habitat. The tree planting events in 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, more that 500 native trees and woody shrubs were planted by volunteers, including families and children, practicing social distancing via a highly organized process in order to keep everyone safe. 2002 saw the return of school groups to plant native trees and shrubs for the benefit of wildlife.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong></strong></p><p>Kishwauketoe Nature Conservancy maintains designation as a Certified Butterfly Garden by documenting the presence of various specific plant and flower species.

The conservancy is periodically awarded grants from these utility companies to plant native grasses and forbs on improved right of ways as well as trees and woody shrubs in other areas of the conservancy.
