In 2017, Eagle Scout Matt Dudzic did prairie restoration and an information kiosk on school grounds. Bird information has been displayed in the kiosks. Aldo Leopold style benches have been built using recycled wood from old light poles.</p>
<p>The updated Smart Growth Plan identifies new “open space and conservation” property on the west shore of Lake Leota. Bald eagles have built a nest in a cottonwood tree on this property.</p>
<p>The past couple of years Evansville's Ash tree population has been affected by the Emerald Ash Borer, as  a member of Tree City USA, the City has a reforestation program and has planted more trees every year than have been taken out. This provides future bird habitat throughout the City as well as other natural areas around Lake Leota and other areas around the City. </p>
<p>Evansville has continued to replace it's Ash tree population with a diversified planting of new trees. The city has also begun to include the replacement of trees that are removed during street reconstruction projects as well. Evansville has remained commited to reforestation and bird habitat. </p>
<p>This has remained the same in 2022 with Ash tree removal we are almost completed the the remaovals. In 2022 we have begun street reconstruction tree replacement policy that any trees taken out from terrace due to a street project are being replaced the following year. </p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Evansville continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 2001.</p>

<p><br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection. (Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Evansville Park &amp; Outdoor Recreation Plan, adopted by the Common Council in 2007, was updated by the City Park and Recreation Board in 2013. In 2012, the National Park Service listed Leonard-Leota Park on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. Improvements to the aquatic environment at Lake Leota continue, with collaborative effort among Evansville Community School District, Boy Scouts, and the City.</p>
<p>In 2022 the City of Evansville has begun looking into inacting a leash law in it's parks and in town. Decision will be made in 2023.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong></strong></p><p>On the south edge of the City between First and Second Streets is Wind Prairie Park. The 5.4 acre parcel was a former city dump. Local organizations restored the area. The Evansville Park and Outdoor Recreation Plan states that:  <em>"Wind Prairie Park is a specialized recreation area consisting of an open space prairie conservation area in the southern part of the city. The area contains a variety of prairie plant species and a few trees that have been planted along the property's boundaries for screening and beautification."</em> The plan also points out that the Park is intended to be a nature preserve. Wind Prairie Park is a local site for the Christmas Bird Count. Eagle Scout Ethan Pierick put up five Bluebird houses in Wind Prairie Park. There is a mowed walking path and wood benches that allow for nature study. The prairie was burned last year as part of a natural maintenance cycle. </p>
<p>In 2016 the prairie was burned and invasive shrubs were removed. A $2,000 purchase of prairie seed from Agrecol was sown in late fall. There were further prairie seedings and volunteers maintained and removed invasives from the area.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong></strong></p><p>The City has maintained rough habitat at the edge of Lake Leota for fish including the installation of several fishcribs, insects, and small birds.</p>
<p>Our community continuously uses the Grove Community School Forest to engage our students in improving habitat. Boy Scouts collected prairie seed and planted it at two orairies being restored along the School Forest Trail.  Throughout the year the nature center works with students to plant trees and shrubs to help create bird nesting habitat.</p>
<p>The City now employs a certified arborist on its staff who has helped us maintain and plant native non invasive tree and shrub species. </p><br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

The regular maintenance of these areas helps control invasive species and allows native prarie species to grow and thrive.</p>
<p>This works has continued to happen on an annual basis for 2022. We do our best to maintain native grass areas and retnetion ponds outsdie of the migratory time periods to allow as much natural habittat as possible for birds.</p><br><br><strong>1.5.1, Implement a municipal moratorium on the trimming of trees and shrubs and the mowing of ditches, storm water retention basins, and other grasslands from May 15 to July 15 to prevent the destruction of active bird nests. (Exceptions: invasive species control and public safety)</strong></strong></p><p>The City maintains its storm water retention basins on a regular basis but lets the native prairie grasses grow througth the Spring and Summer. These areas are not mowed down until after August 1st of each year. </p>
<p>The Evansville Public Works Department continues to maintain its retention basins during non-migratory time periods. This allows for additional migratory bird habitat as well as maintains invasive species to allow for healthy native plant species to grow.</p><br><br><strong>1.5.2, Implement a tree-risk policy that includes specific plans to leave dead trees standing as nesting and foraging resources for birds when it is safe to do so (follow Urban Tree Risk Management, especially pg. 153)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.6.1, Demonstrate the implementation of a program to preserve Chimney Swift nesting and roosting sites (preferred) and/or to construct Chimney Swift towers</strong></strong></p><p>There are Chimney Swifts in the Evansville area, they are known to roost in a local church.

Copies of three American Bird Conservancy brochures are available to attendees: two regarding cats and one on bird collisions. Posters on both topics are periodically displayed at the public library. Children are able to make window silhouettes as an interactive program at the library after school and during the International Migratory Bird Day celebration. Children made window silhouettes for preventing bird collisions and Bird City volunteers discuss the topic at the Library and Nature Center.</p></p>
