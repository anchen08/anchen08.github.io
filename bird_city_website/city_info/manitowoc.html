<p>In January 2021, the City of Manitowoc was awarded a <a href="https://knowlesnelson.org/manitowoc-city-trails-to-be-expanded-thanks-to-knowles-nelson-grant/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Manitowoc City Trails to Expand Thanks to Knowles-Nelson Grant">Knowles-Nelson grant</a> to develop <a href="https://www.manitowoc.org/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=32334" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Bayshore Trail map">a public trail system</a> in the new Bayshore Development.  The goal is to connect the Mariners Trail along the lakefront to Lincoln Park.  The City also allocated dollars to this trail system and a future pedestrian bridge over the Little Manitowoc River to connect to the Lincoln Park Zoo.  There will also be a kayak launch and fishing stations.  The developers of the property donated almost 11 acres of property to remain in conservancy/parkland.  There are plans to plant pollinators along the river in areas disturbed by construction as this is a coastal wetland migratory flyway.  This area will be a great opportunity for birdwatchers and for the placement of educational signs related to birds.  The signs are now completed and ready for installation.  Also in 2021, trees were planted along the newly constructed Bayshore Drive, which will provide additional bird habitat as well. </p>
<p>The Forestry Division applied for and received a Wisconsin Urban Forestry Grant from the Department of Natural Resources which paid for the removal of 23 dead and/or dying trees and replaced them with 46 trees (two new trees for every one removed) in 2022.  In addition, several dozen trees were planted in various parks in 2022 with funds from the Parks Division.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Manitowoc continues to work with members of the Woodland Dunes Nature Center &amp; Preserve to enhance bird habitat through the use of native and fruit bearing trees and other vegetation at the Lakeside Boulevard bluff, the Maritime Drive bluff, the containment disposal facility (CDF) along the City's lakefront, and along the Little Manitowoc River.  </p>
<p>Along with the City of Manitowoc, the Lakeshore Natural Resource Partnership, the Fund for Lake Michigan, and Stantec Consulting Services have been instrumental in developing a <a href="https://www.manitowoc.org/DocumentCenter/View/33390/Silver-Creek-Stream-Restoration-70-percent-12-14-22?bidId=" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Silver Creek Stream Restoration - 70%">restoration plan for Silver Creek Stream</a> which flows through Manitowoc's Silver Creek Park.  Some of the <a href="https://www.lnrp.org/crcip-project-summaries/2021/10/18/silver-creek" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Silver Creek Stream Restoration Goals - LNRP website">goals</a> of the project include stabilizing stream banks, improving stormwater infiltration and reducing direct discharge to the waterway, invasive species control, planting native trees and shrubs increasing the availability of high-quality grassland and forested habitats for migratory songbirds and upland game birds, creating a nectar-rich herbaceous habitat to support pollinators and enhancing the structural complexity of riparian and coastal habitats.</p>

<h4>Limiting or Removing Threats to Birds</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>In 2019, the Lakeshore Natural Resource Partnership and the Friends of the Manitowoc River Watershed hired a consultant to develop a <a href="https://www.manitowoc.org/DocumentCenter/View/27847/Lower-Henry-Schuette-Park-Restoration-Plan-2020?bidId=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restoration plan</a> for the City of Manitowoc's lower Henry Schuette Park.  The primary objective of the project is to restore ecological function and value by establishing native plant communities.  In 2020, work began on removal of invasive species and hazardous trees.  Since 2021, native plants were revegetated, and management programs were developed to provide ongoing environmental monitoring, invasive species control, site stewardship, and vegetation enhancement.  The highlights from 2022 include the removal of dense invasive species in 52 acres along with hand removal in more ecologically sensitive areas and multiple rounds of spot treatment during the growing season, the planting of 168 trees, and the installation of a half acre of native wet meadow seed.  In order to help accomplish this, two volunteer events were held - one to pull garlic mustard in June and one to help with tree planting.  All of these processes will improve the habitat for birds and other wildlife. </p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong></strong></p><p>In 2022, the City of Manitowoc Community Development Department collaborated with the Manitowoc County Soil and Water Conservation Department to introduce native pollinator gardens in several City right-of-ways and in a new parking lot in downtown Manitowoc.  Manitowoc County provided additional funding through a West Foundation Grant, and assisted in native plant selection and establishing a planting plan.  The plantings make the downtown more beautiful but also provide important feeding and nesting areas while also enhancing water quality.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection. (Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>Several hundred acres of Woodland Dunes has been designated a State Natural Area.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong></strong></p><p>The Little Manitowoc River Shorebird Habitat Project was developed to restore, enhance, and provide education within the Little Manitowoc River Conservancy.  The Woodland Dunes Nature Center &amp; Preserve served as the lead for the 11 acre project, which included establishing a songbird and pollinator habitat. The following habitat features were added to the site:  cross log habitat structure, tree stump habitat structure, Osprey nest frame and platform, Purple Martin house, Swallow and Bluebird house, Johnson bat house, and a Wood Duck house. Eight ash trees were removed during re-construction of the nearby Waldo Boulevard and placed in the riverbank area for the cross log habitat structure.  In 2021, several educational signs were added.  Funds for this project were received from various sources, including the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Great Lakes Coastal Program and the Wisconsin Waterfowl Association. This project not only makes the area more bird-friendly but is also a top destination for visiting bird watchers as the site is a very important migratory stopover location for many species of birds and potentially monarch butterflies.</p>
<p>In 2020, the City of Manitowoc acquired approximately four acres of land adjoining Camp Vits Park.  This land was converted from private farmland to parkland and is known as Vetter Trailhead.  The wetland acres on this property will be protected and will be a natural bird habitat for years to come.  In 2021, an easement was acquired from Woodland Dunes, which will connect Camp Park to the Vetter Trailhead where a parking lot was constructed.  This easement will improve access to trails at Camp Vits Park and passive recreational opportunities.  There is a deed restriction on the easement prohibiting bicycle usage, which will help to keep the impact of usage to a minimum.</p>
<p>The restoration project at lower Henry Schuette (mentioned in 1I) is also helping to restore dozens of acres of habitat within the City of Manitowoc.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.3, Document an ongoing community program to incorporate a significant number of native trees, native shrubs, native herbaceous plants, and/or cultivars of native species in public or large-scale private landscaping</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Manitowoc has a history of incorporating native species in public landscaping.  Work is continuing on habitat <a href="https://www.manitowoc.org/DocumentCenter/View/27847/Lower-Henry-Schuette-Park-Restoration-Plan-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Henry Schuette Park Restoration Plan">restoration plan</a> at lower Henry Schuette Park where invasive species (which are killing native trees and plants) and emerald ash borer infected trees are being removed in order to make way for native hardwoods and other species to be planted in this important pollinator area.</p>
<p>Included as part of the <a href="https://www.woodlanddunes.org/restore-the-shore/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Restore the Shore project</a>, Woodland Dunes continues to promote the planting of native hardwood trees and shrubs in home landscapes.  Woodland Dunes also received funding in 2021 to extend tree and shrub planting in the State Nature Area for another two years (5,000 large trees and shrubs), and an additional coastal stopover area of 15 acres is now being restored at the south end of Woodland Dunes, which is only a few yards from Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>The City of Manitowoc held its first Tree for a Tree Program in December of 2018 as an effort to help Manitowoc residents regain some of the urban canopy which will be lost due to the Emerald Ash Borer's devastating effects on the city's ash tree population.  After Christmas, City residents were given the opportunity to exchange their fresh-cut Christmas tree for a voucher for a native, deciduous whip to be planted in spring.  Due to the popularity of this program, it has been funded annually by the City of Manitowoc.</p>
<p>The City of Manitowoc encourages the planting of native trees in their Street Tree Planting Policy by highlighting the native trees on the list of suggested street trees and indicates that these native trees are best adapted to Wisconsin's climate and soils and are also the best trees for native birds and other animals.</p>
<p>In 2022, the City of Manitowoc installed a pollinator garden at the Lincoln Park Zoo.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids.

<p>Signature species: Songbirds, raptors, waterfowl, and shorebirds. </p>
<p>Rare species: Osprey, Red-shouldered Hawk, and Mourning Warbler."</p>
<p>Woodland Dunes has also been designated as an Important Bird Area by the Wisconsin Bird Conservation initiative.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.3, Demonstrate that your community actively raises awareness of its bird assets. Examples include placing a remote web camera on a nest platform; offering regular, public bird-watching field trips; or creating a significant educational resource on your community's birdlife</strong></strong></p><p>The Manitowoc area has been featured in a number of media publications, including features in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Wisconsin Natural Resources magazine, local television news features, Wisconsin Public Television, Discover Wisconsin, and the Visitor Guide for the Manitowoc Area Visitor and Convention Bureau - all highlighting the diversity of birds found in the area. </p>
<p>There are some webcams in the local area where citizens can view birds. Briess Malt &amp; Ingredients Company has a link on their website to a live <a href="http://blog.brewingwithbriess.com/new-live-falcon-cam-atop-the-briess-manitowoc-grain-elevator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Falcon cam</a> atop their grain elevator, and the Woodland Dunes website has an <a href="https://www.woodlanddunes.org/osprey-cam-lite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Osprey Cam</a>, so that people can enjoy birds from the comfort of their own house.  The Osprey nest cam has generated a lot of interest including visits from Green Bay television and local radio and newspaper stories. The City of Manitowoc also has a <a href="http://www.manitowoc-marina.com/about/harborcam" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Manitowoc Marina Harbor Cam">harbor cam</a>, which can be used to pan the harbor and view gulls and waterfowl which is helpful for planning birding trips to the harbor.</p>
<p>Awareness of birds and other wildlife in the area was also raised through many Woodland Dunes Nature Center activities which are advertised on its website, in newspapers, newsletters, Facebook, etc.  Woodland Dunes personnel also provide a weekly column to Seehafer News about wildlife, which are oftentimes bird-related, and four or five times per year, the staff are guests on local radio shows on WOMT to answer questions about local wildlife, including birds.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Park Zoo promotes awareness of birds, such as through their Birds of Prey exhibits.  Information about the birds can be found on the <a href="https://www.manitowoc.org/768/Animals" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Zoo Animals">website</a>.  There is also a boardwalk and birding observation deck by the river.</p>

This must be a multi-day event or a truly exceptional one-day event</strong></strong></p><p>Each year Woodland Dunes hosts its annual Bird Breakfast and Migration Celebration on the second Saturday in May. The Bird Breakfast was inaugurated in 1942 by a local librarian and has been continued by the nature center since the late 1970's. This event generally coincides with World Migratory Bird Day, and includes guided bird walks at different area locations, talks, children’s activities, and bird banding demonstrations.  More than 100 people typically attend the event.</p>
<p>Each year, Woodland Dunes hosts <a href="https://www.woodlanddunes.org/owl-fest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Owl Fest Week 2022">Owlfest</a>, a widely-known event celebrating the migration of Northern Saw-whet Owls which attracts visitors from across the state.  </p>
<p>In 2022, the Wisconsin Society for Ornithology's annual convention was hosted by Woodland Dunes.  Various birding field trips were offered over several days.  Beginning birder workshops took place at Woodland Dunes Nature Center and a Big Sit took place at the Manitowoc Containment area on Lake Michigan where birders had the opportunity to learn shorebird and gull identification.  "Green birding" trips were also offered by kayak or bicycle.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.6, Document that your community maintains a birding trail or hot spot location with educational signage and/or literature. (Note: A birding hotspot alone is not sufficient ï¿½ your community must actively promote birding and public education at the site itself.)</strong></strong></p><p>Woodland Dunes has established and maintains seven miles of trails equipped with educational signage about birds and other natural features.  All trails are open daily from dawn until dusk and are free of charge.</p>
<p>In 2016, a birding "hot spot" was identified at the Manitowoc Containment Disposal Facility (CDF) / Lakeview Park.  This harbor area has been outstanding for birds, including sightings of the White-winged Tern.  Many individuals from the Wisconsin Society for Ornithology have visited the area,  A sign was designated for this area and states "Welcome to One of Wisconsin's Best Birdwatching Hotspots:  The Manitowoc Containment Facility or CDF is a man-made structure designed to hold material excavated during harbor dredging activities.  Because it is essentially an island and lies along the Lake Michigan shore, an important migratory route for many species of birds, it is an important stopover area for many of them.  More than 300 species of birds have been recorded here, some nesting, others feeding and resting during migration.  A cooperative project to improve the quality of habitat for songbirds, and people who use the CDF for recreation is being done by the City of Manitowoc, and Woodland Dunes Nature Center, with support from the US Dept. of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Lakeshore Natural Resource Partnership.  Invasive plant species will be managed, and the area planted with native vegetation which benefits songbirds."  A photo of Ruddy Turnstones is featured on the sign.  </p>
<p> As part of the 2017 Bird Migration Celebration, Woodland Dunes sponsored a trip to the Manitowoc harbor area where a birding hotspot was named the Manitowoc Lakefront Birding Area and was "designated in honor of Dr. Charles Sontag, Emeritus Professor of Biology at the UW Manitowoc whose 50 years of daily observations revealed that more than 300 species of birds have been found at that single location."</p>
<p>The City of Manitowoc's Lincoln Park Zoo has a boardwalk and birding deck next to the river with educational signage.  In 2022, the Lincoln Park Zoological Society received $25,000 grant from the Wisconsin Coastal Management Program to develop a design plan and construction documents to rehabilitate and restore currently unused exhibit space into an aviary to house coastal and wetland birds.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.7, Document that a municipal building has significant bird-friendly landscaping that features native plants AND signage that explains the importance of native plants and providing diverse habitat for birds (e.g., brush piles, water features)</strong></strong></p><p>The Woodland Dunes Nature Center, while not a municipal building, is open to the public and has signage describing several methods employed to make windows safe for birds and has a demonstration area landscaped with native plants specifically for the benefit of birds.</p>
<p>The Manitowoc Senior Center has two bioswales with native pollinator plants and educational signage, and there is one bioswale at Lighthouse Park with native plants and signage.</p><br><br><strong>3.3.1, Document a substantial regular program that educates young people on any of the following topics: climate change, energy efficiency, green/bird-safe buildings, or environmental sustainability</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.3.2, Demonstrate that schools in your community participate in a nationally recognized environmental education program (e.g., Flying WILD, Audubon Adventures) or that your community organizes its own substantial education and outreach program for young people</strong></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Woodland-Dunes-Nature-Center-and-Preserve-101537573056/events/?ref=page_internal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Woodland Dunes Nature Center &amp; Preserve</a> provides environmental education programs in which about 3,000 school children participate each year.  Many of these programs have avian education components, including curricula about bird migration and owls in particular.  Many of these programs have avian education components, including curricula about bird migration and owls in particular.  </p><br><br><strong>3.3.3, Show how your community aids a local youth group (e.g., Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of USA, 4-H Club, etc.) or conservation group in bird-conservation projects (e.g., bluebird trail, habitat restoration, Wood Duck nest boxes, etc.)</strong></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Woodland-Dunes-Nature-Center-and-Preserve-101537573056/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Woodland Dunes</a> works with student groups from UW Green Bay - Manitowoc Campus, Roncalli High School, and Lincoln High School on habitat restoration projects within its preserves and along the shore of Lake Michigan.  Woodland Dunes sponsors units of both Scouting USA and Girl Scouts who participate in bird conservation activities.</p><br><br><strong>3.3.4, Show that your municipality promotes and supports a bird club or other environmentally/ecologically minded club. (Exclusions: garden clubs, unless you demonstrate a strong focus on native plants)</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Manitowoc has working relationships with local environmental and/or ecologically-minded organizations.  For example, the Manitowoc chapter of the Izaak Walton League annually donates trees for the City of Manitowoc Arbor Day Celebration.  In turn, the City of Manitowoc recognizes their donations with plaques by the trees and through various advertisements, as well as by providing a facility for their annual fish fry fundraiser free of charge.   In 2022, the group donated an additional nine trees for Lincoln Park where numerous ash trees were removed.</p>
<p>The City of Manitowoc also provides the Manitowoc Fish &amp; Game group a monthly meeting facility at a discounted rate.  These groups have often donated items and/or monies for various park and zoo projects. </p>
<p>In addition, the Northeast Wisconsin Great Lakes Sports Fisherman operate a <a href="https://www.manitowoc.org/888/Zoo-Rearing-Pond" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="4I - Fish rearing pond">fish rearing pond</a> within the boundaries of the City of Manitowoc's Lincoln Park Zoo.  The fish are eventually released in the river at Manitou Park.</p><br><br><strong>3.4.1, Show that your community works with traditionally underserved communities to increase their access to natural areas, environmental education, birding resources, and local environmental experts</strong></strong></p><p>Woodland Dunes Nature Preserve intentionally provides access to its facilities and preserve at no charge, so that no one is excluded due to cost.  For organized programs, fees are intentionally kept low and are subsidized by Woodland Dunes membership and grants, when available.  Manitowoc has an excellent park system, including access to the Lake Michigan shore, which is freely available to all.  </p>
<p>When feasible, the City of Manitowoc attempts to make park areas handicap accessible.  For example, there are paved trails along the Little Manitowoc River Walkway and a wooden boardwalk and Mobi-Mat on the beach at Red Arrow Park,  The first portion of new trails at Vetter Trailhead are also handicap accessible, until prohibited by the terrain.  These areas are good for bird watching.</p></p>

The Owling 101 program is offered to Kindergarten through 3rd grade students, where they spend several hours learning about owls and their special adaptations, dissecting owl pellets, learning owl calls, and more each October. Children attending the Bird Breakfast, Owlfest, and Enchanted Forest events learn about birds by participating in many activities, and bird education for adults is included in the Wonder of It All monthly program series.  </p>
<p>The Little Manitowoc River area is a popular area for birds.  The Mayor's Youth Action Council adopted this park area and performs cleanups and monthly inspections.  In July 2020, Stantec installed an Osprey nest platform in the Little Manitowoc River project area.  The materials and labor were donated by the A.T.C. and M.J.
