<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Whitewater adopted a comprehensive plan in 2010 that incorporates principles from Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” law regarding land use planning and natural resource management and has been in compliance with that plan since. Specifically, Chapter 7 of the plan addresses working environmental corridors, smart growth areas and opportunities for redevelopment.  This is ongoing in 2018 in the City of Whitewater. This is ongoing in 2019 and 2020 and 2021 and continued in 2022.</p>
<p> </p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>An ad hoc committee of the Urban Forestry Commission, which includes community members, was formed in December 2015 to create a butterfly/hummingbird garden in the Clay Street Nature Park. This community-planted-and-managed garden was installed in 2016 and is intended to provide food for hummingbirds and insects and serve as an educational native planting resource for the community.  In 2017 more native plants were planted and most non-natives were removed and even more importantly, two oak trees were planted in the park. </p>
<p>In 2017 the Urban Forestry Commission began working with the city to restore Walton Oaks Park, which is an oak savannah remnant.  We invited two restoration experts to give us advice on how to proceed and began working to remove invasive plants, like buckthorn, mulberry, garlic mustard and so forth. We utilized many volunteers from both the university and the community in this effort.  This will be an ongoing project and eventually will showcase native wildflowers and plants and provide a bird friendly habitat for bird watchers as well as preserving the magnificent bur oaks some of which are estimated to be more than 300 years old.</p>
<p>The Urban Forestry Commission is continuing to advise the Park and Recreation Board on park plantings. Our mission is to encourage the parks to include native trees, shrubs, and perennials. We asked that Minneiska Park, which is situated adjacent to Trippe Lake and part of a wildlife corridor, be planted with this in mind.</p>
<p>A Chimney Swift tower was built at Cravath Lake Park. The site was chosen because Chimney Swifts were already occupying one of the chimneys in the downtown area in very close proximity to the lake, and the nearby lake provides insects for food. Also, walking/biking path passes nearby so residents can observe the tower and read the informational signage, thereby making the most of an opportunity to educate the public about a declining migratory bird. In 2017 we continued to monitor and clean the tower as necessary.</p>
<p>The Urban Forestry Commission continues in an advisory position for landscape input for any new and revised development in the City of Whitewater. This is ongoing as new projects arise. Our concentration is on native plants to support birdlife and habitat.</p>
<p>In 2018 planning began for the construction of a Purple Martin house in Whitewater. UFC members visited the home of a man who builds Martin houses that can be raised and lowered for cleaning which is a huge advance in being able to maintain them more easily. We researched the type of houses and door openings to try to prevent the invasion by starlings and sparrows, and their needs as far as placement. The Purple Martin will be named the Bird of The Year in 2019 and fundraising will begin to make us able to construct and place our first house in 2019.</p>
<p>On April 4th, 2020, our new Purple Martin House was installed and opened for scouts! Three pairs of Purple Martins took up residence and successfully fledged their clutches! A nearby neighbor provided maintenance and updates to the Urban Forestry Commission, some of which were shared on local media. It was a great success, and we are hoping to purchase a second house in 2021.</p>
<p>In early April of 2021 we were finally able to dedicate our first Purple Martin House! The pandemic put this off for a year. Family members of the donors traveled from as far away as California for this dedication and were extremely grateful to finally be able to have the ceremony and view the 16 unit Martin House in person. Also in 2021 the UFC and city of Whitewater installed our second Martin House at our Clay Street Nature Park. This park is the location of two native plant beds also and is in a highly trafficked pedestrial area. We received many questions, comments and thanks for the work that is going on in this park. Our goal is to continue to place these homes around the city.</p>
<p>2022 was a very big year for the City of Whitewater! We had citizen monitoring and upkeep of our two established Purple Martin Houses which are 16 unit 'condos' that can be raised and lowered to keep sparrows out and open more units for purple martins. <strong>37 martins fledged</strong> from our two houses this year!! We have recieved a lot of input from community members who really enjoy being able to watch these fun and very social birds. </p>
<p>In 2022 we completed fundraising for our third Purple Martin House and it was installed in our new Arboretum at Starin Park. This house will be dedicated during our Earth Day, Arbor Day, Migratory Bird Celebration Week in April 2023.  </p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Whitewater’s Chamber of Commerce sponsored Whitewater’s Main Street Festival in September 2017. The Urban Forestry Commission staffed a booth using this opportunity to provide information and educational materials to the public on links between a healthy urban forest and Whitewater's role as a Bird City. Handouts were available on native plantings, hazards to birds, bird life, a Snowy Owl brochure (Whitewater's Bird of the Year), bird carvings by a local artist and photos of Whitewater birds and where they were seen, and bird games to play. Many people stopped and talked about their backyard birds and the newly erected Swift Tower.</p>
<p>In 2018, we offered children the opportunity to deconstruct bird nests (after checking with the Wisconsin DNR to make sure it was alright to harvest windfall nests) and pose with their faces in a Snowy Owl cutout poster. We also showed a display of the birds that can be found in our ongoing restoration of Walton Oaks Park. </p>
<p>The Urban Forestry Commission in 2020 continued to work with Whitewater's City Forester to conduct a burn at Walton Oaks Preserve to maintain the habitat for the many birds that live there. This preserve is located in a location that is near homes and also is partially near a very wet area which makes these burns difficult. We are still hoping for a burn this winter.</p>
<p>Walton Oaks Park, home of a savanah remnant and Effigy Mounds Park which is one of a few indian mounds in the state are both being maintained with burns, planting of additional natives and signage in 2021. </p>
<p>As part of the establishment of the Arboretum at Starin Park, we hired a landscape designer named Danielle Bell of Native Roots who designed our planting areas for us. We found her through our local Wild Ones chapter. The first phase of planting areas was installed and maintained in 2022 including many plants and shrubs that provide food to birds throughout the season. </p><br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong></strong></p><p>Whitewater continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation following its initial award in 1994.</p>
<p>Whitewater continues to be a proud Tree City USA participant in 2020.</p>
<p> Whitewater continues to be a proud Tree City USA in 2021.</p>
<p>Whitewater continued to be a proud Tree City USA in 2022.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong></strong></p><p>In March of 2017 a UFC member gave a presentation on the importance of native plants which support native insects, which, in turn, support native birds, at the Irvin L. Young Library in Whitewater.  The evening presentation was very well received and attended by members from our own community and also surrounding communities.  The emphasis was on letting people know that ALL birds feeds insects to their young in the nest and that without native plants to support native insects and pollinators, this food source would not exist for nestling birds.  </p>
<p>The UFC Chair is a Master Gardener and works online to educate people about the importance of native plants to the environment, birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>In 2021 UFC members took every opportunity to educate our residents on the importance of native plants for pollinators, both at meetings and in interactions with residents at City Market.</p>
<p>In 2022 Whitewater had several residents posting Mow Free May signs and others encouraging people to leave the lawn until June. The city ignored these lawns (as in didn't cite them) and many left their signs up all summer to educate people about the importance of pollinators.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong></strong></p><p>Urban Forestry Commission Chair, Sherry Stanek, is in the process of completing the DNR's Wisconsin Tree Management Institute program, having started in October of 2022. Session 2 begins in just under two weeks and the program will be finished in June of 2023.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>In 2017 Whitewater began the restoration of Walton Oaks Park, an oak savanna remnant.</p>
<p>Work continued in 2018 on Walton Oaks Park, removing invasives in almost the entire 2.4 acre park.  In the area that was cleared in 2017, grasses and some natives plants show signs of returning and are also important as fuel for a spring burn in 2019 which is very important to clear more of the invasives like red cedars that are becoming numerous and are not welcome as we attempt to restore this to savanna status.</p>
<p>In 2019 Our Whitewater Urban Forestry Commission began a fundraiser to erect one, or hopefully, more Purple Martin Houses in Whitewater to support this bird species.  We were very fortunate to have the first one donated by the family of one of our members who passed away last year who was a very avid bird lover, bird artist and bird watcher!  This Purple Martin House will be dedicated on April 4, 2020 with our member's family present.  We will also work to finish the fundraising that has begun for a second Purple Martin House in another suitable location in the city.</p>
<p>In 2021 our second Purple Martin House, a large 16 unit bird condo we like to joke, was installed in late March and was found in early April by scouts! We had several successful nests if Purple Martins in this new house and also in our 1st house that was put up in 2019. We had a total of 23 baby Martins fledge in 2021.</p>
<p>In 2022 our purple martin flock fledged 37 babies from our two martin houses! Dedicated volunteers monitor and maintain these beautiful houses and city staff cover them once the babies fledge  and the next boxes are cleaned to prevent others birds from becoming established in the 32 'apartments'.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection.

<p>In 2018 100 street trees were planted. Of those all but 15 were native to Wisconsin or cultivars bred for resistance (such as Dutch Elm disease).</p>
<p>In 2020, the Whitewater Urban Forestry Commission began the process of establishing an accredited arboretum in our city. This process has so far included initial planning and meeting with the Whitewater Parks and Recreation Board to obtain the go ahead to proceed, the organization of a subcommittee consisting of the UFC, City Forester and community volunteers with the collaboration and support of The Historic Starin Park Neighborhood, the University of Whitewater Sustainability Office, the Whitewater Unified School District and, in the future, corporate sponsors. We are seeking Level 1 Accreditation through ArbNet.org for the development of the woodland in our current Starin Park, which is one of the oldest in the state and consists of 34.5 acres of woodland, a state of the art baseball diamond, softball and baseball fields, a Senior Center, playground and exercise opportunities to include the arboretum. </p>
<p>The Urban Forestry Commission, along with the City Forester, continues to increase the number and variety of native trees planted in our city each year! We are working to educate ourselves on this topic so that we can better educate our community about the importance of native plants, shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>In 2019 the City of Whitewater planted more than 100 trees, with an emphasis on native trees and trees that give to the birds, either habitat or food or both.</p>
<p>In 2021 the city planted 70% natives trees on terraces and in public parks and open spaces. The number continues to grow each year.</p>
<p>In 2022, as part of the establishment of the Arboretum at Starin Park, nearly 200 native trees and shrubs were planted in Whitewater! Beds were constructed, mulched and kept watered and weeded all summer and we had many opportunities to educate residents as we worked in the arboretum. </p>
<p> </p><br><br><strong>1.3.4, Attach an ordinance or other official policy that requires your community to prescribe at least 50% of its annual street tree budget AND at least 75% of its non-street tree budget (e.g., parks, schools, institutional properties, publicly owned natural areas, etc.) for native species and their cultivars and hybrids. (Recommendations for SE WI)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.5, Attach a copy of a local ordinance to demonstrate that your community does not restrict natural/native landscaping that emphasizes native plants and non-turf lawns</strong></strong></p><p>Whitewater’s Urban Forestry Commission was charged by Whitewater’s Common Council with drafting a Natural Landscape Ordinance ensuring that homeowners had legal rights and protection to maintain a non-turf grass natural landscape. Approved landscapes include, but are not limited to: woodland, oak savanna, prairie, sustenance gardens, flower gardens, and wetlands. The ordinance also defines various invasive plants and methods to eradicate them. The ordinance was approved by the Common Council. Continuing.</p>
<p>13.10.020 - Natural landscape gardens allowed.</p>
<p>(a) A natural heritage garden, ornamental garden, rain garden and/or sustenance garden may be planted if it is in compliance with the following provisions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) The garden does not violate any other City of Whitewater ordinance.</p>
<p>(2) The garden is authorized by the owner or occupier with written permission as verified by owner.</p>
<p>(3) The garden, or any portion thereof, does not encroach on any property ownership line or public right-of-way.</p>
<p>In 2021 UFC worked to maintain Clay Street Nature Park's native gardens and offered information to residents on how to plant their own.</p>
<p>2022 was an active year at the Clay Street Nature Park. High school volunteers worked to get the native plant beds cleaned up and in order for the summer and really enjoyed having the purple martins around to keep them company. </p><br><br><strong>1.4.1, Show that your community offers the public information on how they can control and remove invasive species in order to improve or maintain bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Whitewater ordinance 13.10.050 - Noxious weeds does not allow invasives in the city. The UFC has also made information available on Japanese Knotweed control at the public library.</p>
<p>(a) The following noxious weeds are prohibited in natural landscape gardens:</p>
<p>(1) Buckthorn (Common glossy) (Rhamnus cathartica);</p>
<p>(2) Burdock (Arctium);</p>

<p>In 2020, Whitewater's Urban Forestry Commission worked to educate the public about the overuse of salt for snow and ice removal, and it's detrimental effects on water and soil. This was published in the local online newspaper and on the city's website. </p>
<p>In 2021 Whitewater's Urban Forestry Commission had a table at our weekly City Market to inform citizens about invasive plants and trees, how to select natives that can give them the same basic characteristics (purplish leaves for instance) and how to avoid planting them in the first place. We handed out DNR information sheets to give them something to work with in identifying invasives.</p>
<p>in 2022 the Urban Forestry Commission held  several events and workshops to educate children and adults about the importance of native plants for birds and habitat availability. </p><br><br><strong>1.4.2, Demonstrate that your community offers a program for private property owners who are interested in dealing with invasive plants that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.4.3, Show that your community works on public lands to control invasive species that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>In 2017, the Urban Forestry Commission organized the removal of Japanese Knotweed in our community.  Additionally, community members are working to control garlic mustard which has been spreading in the community.  We continue to work on removing and controlling invasives in our parks and preserves. In addition to citywide invasive monitoring, the UFC with the City of Whitewater and community are aggressively working to remove invasives at Walton Oaks Park. </p>
<p>Work continued in 2018 by city staff to control and kill a large stand of Japanese Knotweed that is trying to spread along Whitewater Creek.</p>
<p>Work continues to stop Japanese Knotweed and other invasives from spreading in city parks and green spaces.</p>
<p>In 2020 Whitewater maintenance staff burned and treated Japanese Knotweed and continues to try to stop its spread.</p>
<p> In 2022 we worked to inform people about garlic mustard. We instructed the community to pull the plants BEFORE the flowers on the plant go to seed and to pull up the roots too.</p><br><br><strong>1.5.1, Implement a municipal moratorium on the trimming of trees and shrubs and the mowing of ditches, storm water retention basins, and other grasslands from May 15 to July 15 to prevent the destruction of active bird nests.

<p>In 2020 the Whitewater Urban Forestry Commission continued to maintain and monitor our Chimney Swift Tower located at Cravath Lakefront Park in the city. There was evidence of nesting in the spring from the previous year!</p>
<p>In 2021 again, there was evidence found of nesting Swifts in our Chimney Swift Tower!</p>
<p>In 2022 we continued to see residents at the Chimney Swift Tower that was installed in 2017 as well as beginning to monitor the chimney structure at Whitewater Middle School which is a huge gathering place for chimney swifts. We attempted to do a count in the fall, but before we could do it, they all left! Next year we will be ready!</p><br><br><strong>1.6.2, Document the establishment of a program to promote the conservation of Purple Martins through research, state-of-the-art management techniques, or public education</strong></strong></p><p>The Whitewater Urban Forestry Commission began fundraising for the purchase of a Purple Martin House for placement in the city. The fundraising was successful and our purchased, multi unit Purple Martin House was opened for business on April 4, 2020. Three families of martins were successfully fledged! The house is being monitored and sparrows and other birds removed regularly by a volunteer who is a neighbor to the park where it is located. The house was cleaned and covered this fall and will be reopened for scouts and returners in early April 2021.</p>
<p>in 2021 our second large Martin House was installed, found by scouts and fledged several babies!</p>
<p> In 2022 <strong>37 purple martins fledged </strong>from our two large martin houses/condos! We had a few eggs that didn't hatch, but all that hatched survived.</p><br><br><strong>2.1.1, Describe your community's educational program to control free-roaming cats and/or the manner in which you actively publicize the Cats Indoors initiative</strong></strong></p><p>The Urban Forestry Committee had a table set up at the Main Street Festival, farmer's markets, and other public events with literature focusing on keeping birds safe from both window strikes and free-roaming cats. Literature is also available at the public library, the city’s municipal building and other venues in and around Whitewater. Pages devoted to Bird City Whitewater are online on the city’s <a href="https://www.whitewater-wi.gov/284/Bird-City-Wisconsin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UFC webpage</a> outlining good practices for limiting the hazards to birds. The City of Whitewater also has an ordinance against free-roaming pets.</p>
<p>In 2020 I personally spoke to various community members about keeping their cats indoors. The city does have a leash law for cats, but many residents don't obey it. Many don't realize it is an ordinance in the city and aren't aware of how much damage cats can do to bird populations.  </p>
<p>Along with continuing to make brochures about hazards to birds available to the public at the library and other city locations, the UFC purchased copies of catalogues advertising outdoor enclosures of varying designs for cats and placed them at the library and included them on display tables. Future work to limit hazards to birds will include working with Studio 84 and MakerSpace to design and create patterns for constructing “Catios,” or outdoor cat enclosures to keep bird safe from domestic cat predation. In 2017, we continued to educate the community about the dangers that cats pose to birds, and worked to get the word out. </p>
<p>iIn 2021 Urban Forestry members hosted a table every other week at our city's City Market, a farmer's market, and distributed information about keeping cats indoors, catios and other information about protecting birds.</p>
<p>In 2022, UFC continued to provide information to educate residents about our ordinances requiring cats to be on leashes if they are out of doors. We provide information about 'Catios' or enclosures for keeping cats outdoors safely. </p>

In 2017 the Urban Forestry Commission continued to work to make sure that property owners have access to information available to limit the harm to birds from window strikes.</p>
<p>2020 was a very difficult year for getting our brochures about bird strikes and keeping cats indoors because of the Covid-19 virus. The library and city office were closed to the public for much of the year. This is something we hope will improve next year as the vaccine becomes widely applied, allowing the public to congregate again.</p>
<p>In 2021 Urban Forestry members distributed information about preventing window strikes.</p>
<p>In 2022 Urban Forestry members continued to distribut information about preventing window strikes.</p></p>

<p>In 2020 the Whitewater Urban Forestry Commission had planned the dedication of an Oak tree for Arbor Day as well as the dedication of our first Purple Martin House. Both of these events had to be postponed because of the pandemic. I, as Chair of the UFC, did write and submit articles to our local paper with photos to announce them during the year. </p>
<p>In 2020 we had planned to hold a dedication event for our new Purple Martin House located in Minnieska Park in Whitwater.  Like our Earth Day celebration, we were unable to hold this event because of the public health concerns with gatherings.  We would still like to dedicate this house in 2021, bringing in the family of the man who sponsored our first house. Hopefully we will be able to do this for IMBD!</p>
<p>We were not able to hold an event this year because of the 2020 pandemic. The Fair offered an opportunity to  paint a migratory bird mural, measure oneself on the wingspan banner, a Snowy Owl Cutout that allowed children to pose as a Snowy Owl for pictures, table with wildflower plantings, Mariette Nowak giving information on Wisconsin Wild Ones and her book on backyard plantings for birds, oriole bird feeder construction,  Walton Oak Park brochures and lists of birds found there, a computer set up with a scrolling presentation of photos of migratory birds that pass through Whitewater, informational brochures, and 3 featured migratory birds, Robin, Sandhill Crane, and White Pelican.  Pictures of these birds were poster size and maps of their migratory journeys were featured.  There was a table that offered games and coloring sheets about migratory birds.  Many of the ideas for this celebration came from the wonderful Environment for the America's site, including a large puzzle made out of their poster.</p>
<p>In 2018 the Urban Forestry Commission celebrated International Migratory Bird Day at our city's Main Street Festival. We had large displays showing migratory maps, we featured games showing the dangers that migrating birds may encounter, (like overhead wires and predators) as well as a Migratory Bird bean bag game that required players to throw the correct bird bag into their correct migration hole.  We offered migration puzzles and Great Lakes Migration posters that showed in detail, the birds that migrate into and out of our area.</p>
<p>In 2019 The Urban Forestry Commission encouraged citizens to participate in the Great Backyard Bird Count.</p>
<p>In 2021 UFC members decorated the large display window at our local library for the month of April to celebrate educate residents about World Migratory Bird Day, Arbor Day and Earth Day. The display was very well recieved and resulted in discussions and participation in our weeklong activites, socially distanced, at Starin Park.</p>
<p>On April 30, 2022, the Urban Forestry Commission held it's World Migratory Bird Day celebration at the Arboretum at Starin Park. We collaborated with Whitewater Unites Lives and provided several activities for adults and children that were really well attended and recieved. </p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane43"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_43"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_43"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_gallery cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_245"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_245" id="cblabcbfv_245"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong></strong></p><p>The Whitewater Urban Forestry Commission launched a <a href="https://www.whitewater-wi.gov/284/Bird-City-Wisconsin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bird City webpage</a> that includes information on many bird conservation related topics, including loss of habitat, invasive plant species, creating backyard habitat, hazards to birds and preventing them, nest boxes, and feeding birds. Supplemental links include the Wisconsin Society for Ornithology, Wild Ones, American Bird Conservancy, Bird City Wisconsin, and 2 videos, one on Bird City Wisconsin and a presentation on Whitewater's birds by Scott Weberpal, bird enthusiast and photographer. This is ongoing.</p>
<p>In 2021 UFC distriuted Backyard Birdcount materials to children and families to help them appreciate the birds right around them.</p>
<p>In 2022 UFC hosted two large display windows at the Irvin L. Young Library teaching about trees, native plants and birds. One of the windows was specifically devoted to birds and World Migratory Bird Day with lots of information on welcoming birds to your yards by planting native plants and providing food with feeders. </p>

<p><br><br><strong>3.2.5, Describe your community-sponsored annual bird festival. This must be a multi-day event or a truly exceptional one-day event</strong></strong></p><p>in 2017 the Whitewater Arts Alliance sponsored its 3rd annual Artrageous Bird Photography Contest.  The photos are on display for an extended period of time and then an event is held to judge and award prizes.  (Printout of Arts Alliance flyer in photo gallery)</p>
<p>On April 30, 2022 the Urban Forestry Commission collaborated with Whitewater Unites Lives for a Children's Day. We had adults and kids measure their "wingspans" with our life sized Wingspan Banner, pose for pictures with our Hoo's a Snowy Owl cutout painting and participate in tree activities as well! The day was very well attended and included lots of other activities and crafts as well as lots of food.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.6, Document that your community maintains a birding trail or hot spot location with educational signage and/or literature. (Note: A birding hotspot alone is not sufficient ï¿½ your community must actively promote birding and public education at the site itself.)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.2.7, Document that a municipal building has significant bird-friendly landscaping that features native plants AND signage that explains the importance of native plants and providing diverse habitat for birds (e.g., brush piles, water features)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.3.1, Document a substantial regular program that educates young people on any of the following topics: climate change, energy efficiency, green/bird-safe buildings, or environmental sustainability</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.3.2, Demonstrate that schools in your community participate in a nationally recognized environmental education program (e.g., Flying WILD, Audubon Adventures) or that your community organizes its own substantial education and outreach program for young people</strong></strong></p><p>In 2017, the Urban Forestry Commission was very active in our schools. We presented interactive educational opportunities for kids to learn about the importance of oak trees in the ecosystem, especially with regard to habitats for birds and other wildlife.  Children learned how to tell if an acorn is viable or not, they created ornaments from the unviable acorns and another class is starting oak tree seedings with viable acorns.  Another class learned about all the birds, animals and insects that benefit from oak trees by taking part in placing these animals and birds on a large oak tree panel (in photo gallery). They were also told about the Territorial Oak in Whitewater that marked the beginning of the city when early surveyors were platting out the town.  Students from UW-W helped with these classroom projects.</p>
<p>In 2020 the Whitewater Urban Forestry Commission worked in partnership and as mentor with the University of Wisconsin Whitewater's SAGE group which is devoted to preserving the environment, climate change, and all that this entails. Their project was interrupted because of the pandemic, but we still hope to complete their plan to plant 50 trees in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. </p>
<p>The pandemic has caused a lot of disruptions in the UFC's efforts to hold programs in schools. Therefore, the only chance we had to interact with kids was during the weekly City Market farmer's market in Whitewater. We were able to answer questions about birds, especially Purple Martins because of our adding two Purple Martin Houses in the last couple of years and our ongoing effort to raise the money for a third house to be installed at our new Arboretum at Starin Park.</p>
<p>In 2022 Whitewater's Urban Forestry Commission hosted a program on native trees and plants and their importance to birds and insects. We also had High School and Middle School kids plant a number of native shrubs at the Arboretum at Starin Park along with exercises teaching how to identify a tree by it's leaves, bark and other criteria.</p><br><br><strong>3.3.3, Show how your community aids a local youth group (e.g., Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of USA, 4-H Club, etc.) or conservation group in bird-conservation projects (e.g., bluebird trail, habitat restoration, Wood Duck nest boxes, etc.)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.3.4, Show that your municipality promotes and supports a bird club or other environmentally/ecologically minded club.

<p>In 2020 UFC published in our online Newspaper, The Whitewater Banner, an invitation for residents to participate in the Christmas Bird Count. </p>
<p> In 2022 UFC provided handouts at our library encouraging residents to participate in the Christmas Bird Count.</p><br><br><strong>3.6.1, Demonstrate that your community is represented in at least one citizen science bird-monitoring program (e.g., the Christmas Bird Count, Great Backyard Bird Count, Swift Night Out)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.6.2, Attach results from organized bird monitoring or data obtained from researchers or volunteers in the local park system.

We also planted nearly 200 trees and shrubs, many of them 2 and 3" caliper at the Arboretum. We taught Whitewater High School and Middle School students about the importance of making changes to try to impact climate change. We held a workshop on geology that showed what is happening with our climate over time. </p>
