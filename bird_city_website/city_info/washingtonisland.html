<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>Door County has developed an extensive comprehensive plan that is in compliance with Wisconsin’s “Smart Growth” law for land use planning and natural resource management. The plan was adopted in 2009 and envisions that<strong> “in the year 2030, Door County’s rural land uses are balanced between residential and economic activities and natural resource preservation.”   </strong>It incorporates strong zoning ordinances for wetlands, woodlands and natural areas with the goal that public access to and recreational opportunities utilizing green space and the water are diverse and widespread with regards to conservation and preservation. The Town of Washington (which includes Washington Island as well as Pilot, Hog, Detroit, Plum and Rock Islands) is governed by all Door County Zoning requirements and thus has also adopted the Door County Smart Growth law for land use.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.4, Demonstrate that your community has been awarded Tree City USA status by the National Arbor Day Foundation</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community.

In Volume II, Chapter 2 is dedicated to wetland zoning and natural areas while Chapter 5 is dedicated to woodlands. These chapters outline specific goals while highlighting the importance of preservation and enhancement of these areas. These goals directly give protection to wildlife, such as birds, through habitat management and natural resource guidelines.</p>
<p>In addition, the federally owned islands that are part of the Town of Washington are all designated National Wildlife Refuges. Rock Island, which is owned by the State of Wisconsin, is protected by Natural Resources Administrative Code and state natural resources statues.

All citizens of the county are urged to celebrate the observance in support of efforts to protect and conserve migratory birds and their habitats. The Town celebrates IMDB during the annual Door Islands Bird Festival.</p>
<p>The Art &amp; Nature Center sponsored the Washington Islands Birding Festival from May 13-15 which coinsided with International Migratory Bird Day.  Various guided bird hikes were led at numerous locations on Washington Island.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane44"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_44"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_44"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_delimiter cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_247"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_247" id="cblabcbfv_247"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.2.2, Attach a state publication showing that there is a segment of the Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail or a designated Important Bird Area within or adjacent to your community</strong></strong></p><p>The Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail includes one location on Washington Island: the Jackson Harbor Town Park &amp; Jackson Harbor Ridges State Natural Area.

<h4>Community Forest Management</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>3.2.3, Demonstrate that your community actively raises awareness of its bird assets. Examples include placing a remote web camera on a nest platform; offering regular, public bird-watching field trips; or creating a significant educational resource on your community's birdlife</strong></strong></p><p>The Door County Visitors Bureau has published an excellent brochure entitled “A Guide to Birding in Door County.” It is notable for its list and map of key birding locations, a photo checklist of key species, and an ethical guide to birding. The map comes is color with major roads listed and lists the major birding locations in the Town of Washington.</p>
<p>Door County publishes an extensive guide entitled “A Guide to Significant Wildlife Habitat and Natural Areas of Door County, Wisconsin.” The Town of Washington is covered extensively (pages 130-137) and includes descriptions of wildlife areas such as Figenschau Bay, Little Lake and four coastland wetlands:  Coffee Swamp, Jackson Harbor Ridges, and Big and Little Marshes. All of these areas are used by migrating waterfowl and other birds.</p>
<p> The Art and Nature Center leads weekly hikes in July and August that educate the public on flora and fauna which includes birds sitings.  The ANC also has a native garden that is used as a means to educate the public on the importance of native plants and ecosystems in the environment.  The ANC also has a Facebook page that frequently posts nature photos that include many birds, especially during the spring migration and the winter birds seen on Lake Michigan.  Members of the Washington Island Birding FaceBook page routinely post bird sitings seen on Washington Island through out the year.</p></p>

<p>Farming on Washington Island is generally conducted by small hobby farmers rather than large commercial farming operations. The largest commercial farmer on the Island is a certified organic farmer who uses no harmful fertilizers or chemicals on his crops. Many local landowners delay hay mowing on their fields until after the nesting period for grassland birds has ended in order to preserve breeding habitats for birds.</p><br><br><strong>3.6.1, Demonstrate that your community is represented in at least one citizen science bird-monitoring program (e.g., the Christmas Bird Count, Great Backyard Bird Count, Swift Night Out)</strong></strong></p><p>Washington Island residents have participated in the Christmas Bird count since 2001.</p>

Those hikes have been valuable sources of birding information and sightings, many of which have been reported to ebird.org. A quick look at <a href="https://ebird.org/home" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ebird.org</a> indicates that 159 species of birds were sighted in the Town of Washington in 2015. The same website includes bird-sighting counts since 2011 for the Town. In addition, Washington Island residents work in conjunction with the government to survey and monitor Osprey and Eagle nesting and Mute Swan control.</p>
<p>The Town of Washington is an integral part of the Mississippi River Flyway and some species from the Atlantic Flyway have migratory paths that come close to Washington Island. As a result, the Town of Washington has been host to a variety of quite rare bird visitors including: Black Vulture, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Magnificent Frigate Bird, Western Kingbird, Couch’s/Tropical Kingbird, and the Crested Caracara. As bird monitoring increases, it is apparent that the Grand Traverse Archipelago (of which the Town of Washington is a part) provides an essential stopover for thousands of migrating birds. The variety and rarity of these birds is a significant draw for the birding community and has led to renewed local interest in protecting bird habitat.</p><br><br><strong>3.7.1, Resolution: Attach a copy of your community's officially enacted resolution.
