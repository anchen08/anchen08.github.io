(Exclusions: trap, neuter, release/return programs)</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of Elm Grove has a yearly contract, that is renewed, with the Elmbrook Humane Society.  This contract covers the pick up and disposition of stray cats.  They attempt to find the owner, but if they are unsuccessful will work to find them a home once neutered. All of their studies have shown that simply removing cats from an area does not solve the problem as unaltered cats will move into an area that is now open.  Of note, there is not a large outdoor cat population in our village as the statistics show the following:</p>
<p>2020–10 cats</p>
<p>2021–8 cats</p>
<p>2022–1 cat</p>

On the first Saturday in June at the Brookfield Farmers Market from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. celebrate the anniversary of the statewide program known as Bird City. Residents can learn about backyard plantings that will attract birds including hummingbirds. Elm Grove Forester Ron Hill will provide suggestions for landscaping for migratory birds during the event.</p>
<p>Local activism is at the heart of effective conservation, and it’s what World Migratory Bird Day is all about. The annual event is now coordinated by Environment for the Americas and has gained widespread popularity, hosted by over 450 organizations throughout the Western Hemisphere. More so than any other state in the nation, Wisconsin's eyes have been fixed on the spectacle of migration during the month of May. Prime bird migration routes are along the Great Lakes and Mississippi River. The Elm Grove/Brookfield event will be held on the Brookfield City Hall grounds during the weekly Farmers Market event which draws large crowds. Visitors will learn about the Bird City program and what is required to maintain “Flight Status”.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane43"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_43"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_43"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_gallery cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_245"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_245" id="cblabcbfv_245"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong></strong></p><p>Elm Grove’s website (https://www.elmgrovewi.org) provides information on bird conservation and landscaping for natural habitat that benefits wildlife as well as a variety of additional links on its website.
