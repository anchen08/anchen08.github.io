(Exclusions: leash laws; prohibitions against disturbing nests and wildlife; areas consisting primarily of mowed grass)</strong></strong></p><p>Tall Pines Conservancy has protected 164 acres within the Village of Chenequa under conservancy. Although some lands are under agricultural cultivation, important wetlands and dense forests are also under conservation agreements. Additionally, they have a 40-acre prairie restoration parcel, maintained by the owner. Also, 47.96 acres within the Village of Chenequa of forest land is enrolled in the Wisconsin Managed Forest Law (MFL) program. This program administered by the WI-DNR is a long-term contract with the property owners which insures sound forest management.</p>
<p>To further protect critical wildlife habitat, the Village of Chenequa has two ordinances which protect shore lands and wetland. The “Removal of Shore Cover” ordinance regulates the cutting of trees and shrubbery within 75 feet of the shoreline and no more than 20% of the shoreline may be cleared of natural vegetation. The “Shore land-Wetland” ordinance provides protection to wetlands and shore lands, defining accepted land use practices.</p>
<p>In addition to Tall Pines and MFL, some residents have also made the effort to practice conservation within their property by preserving oak savannas, prairies and forested areas, all conducive to enhancing bird populations.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2021, the Village of Chenequa was involved in a Waukesha County Hwy realinement project. During this project several roads were abandoned creating a large green space. The Village of Chenequa took advantage of this green space to plant 55 trees and shrubs to help reforest the site. In addition, Waukesha County laid down a pollinator seed mix. </p>
<p>Chenequa’s monthly newsletters address pertinent seasonal information. For example, spring's general focus is regarding shoreline restoration and improvement. In regards to reducing erosion as well as preserving wildlife habitat. Summer's general focus typically aims to answer resident questions and concerns. This is also a great time to recommend the use of less/no insecticides and alternatives to using insecticides, tree diseases and what can be done regarding them. Fall's general focus is on preservation of bushes/trees for winter, etc. It is their intention to include in future newsletters landscaping recommendations and plantings conducive to attracting and feeding song birds.</p><br><br><strong>1.3.1, Document a program to support the establishment of natural lawns and native landscaping, possibly including public presentations of Audubon's Plants for Birds Initiative (contact them for a presentation kit)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.3.2, Show that your community has restored at least two acres of woodlands, wetlands, or prairie</strong></strong></p><p>We are still in the process of working with a village resident to convert a 10-acre agricultural field into an oak savanna. This is a very costly, time-consuming process. However, when complete, the new site will draw a diverse variety of unique wildlife. In addition, Chenequa has assisted this resident in removing all invasive species on the remaining 40 acres of the property. This has been a huge project for the homeowner and will be a significant financial investment for many years to come.</p>
<p>The Village of Chenequa also has great pride in the restoration efforts that have been made on Village grounds. The Village owns approximately 7.8 acres of land in which are extensively managed to eliminate invasive species and encourage the growth of native grasses, trees and shrubs. On a quick walk around the Village of Chenequas grounds you will find rain gardens, native prairie grass/wildflowers, native trees/shrubs and most importantly little to no invasive species. </p>
<p>In the fall of 2021 the Village recontstructed the Pine Lake Launch site. We took advantage of this project to restore a healthy buffer along the lake frontage. It was our goal to introduce native flowers, grasses, srhubs and trees in an attempt to inspire residents to do the same on thier properties.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2021, the Pine Lake Yacht Club formed a board known as the "Pine Lake Preservation Team". This board has been working close with the Village of Chenequa to provide clear and concise infromation to Pine Lake residents about what a shoreline buffer is, why it is important and how they can preserve and improve it. </p>
<p>There are many other properties in Chenequa that have used the assitance of our highway/forestry department to develp a plan to restore their woodlands. It seems that the enthusiasum to restore woodlands/praries it at an all time high.  </p></p>
