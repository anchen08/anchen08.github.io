<p> </p><br><br><strong>3.2.2, Attach a state publication showing that there is a segment of the Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail or a designated Important Bird Area within or adjacent to your community</strong></strong></p><p>The Village of Ferryville is included within the Upper Mississippi National Wildlife Refuge as part of Pool #9. The area also is listed as an Important Birding Area and is part of the Audubon Society’s Great River Birding Trail. The Rush Creek State Natural Area is located a short distance to the north of Ferryville and is included in the Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail guide. This area is a mix of dry prairie and oak forest that is frequented by many songbirds during migration. The Kentucky Warbler is a signature species in the area. Bald Eagles are also frequently found nesting in and around Ferryville. During the 2022 Bald Eagle survey on Pool #9, more bald eagle nests were observed than any other place in the lower 48 states.  This included those along the Iowa side of the Mississippi River. Ferryville Tourism has worked with an environmental specialist to produce and distribute a book of hiking/birding trails in our immediate area.  Over 350 have been distributed so far.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.3, Demonstrate that your community actively raises awareness of its bird assets.

This must be a multi-day event or a truly exceptional one-day event</strong></strong></p><p>The Ferryville Tourism Council sponsors an annual Bald Eagle Day on the first Saturday of March. This annual event is co-sponsored by the Friends of Pool 9.  Events for the day include educational live bird programs provided by the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota, bald eagle nest building, bird feeder building stations, crafts, and programs provided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Decorah Raptor Project.   The Village of Ferryville has 180 residents. Bald Eagle Day 2020 had a record number of attendees at over 500! We attribute part of this increase to a beautiful full color article that came out just days before our event in the Wisconsin Electric Cooperative's magazine.  People from 76 communities in Wis. and 3 in each of Iowa and Minnesota attended.  Over 50 children made bird feeders and crafts.  The Raptor Research Project (the Decorah Eagle Cam) did an excellent program. A team of 5 students and their advisor from the biology club of De Soto High School helped all day.  Friends of Pool 9 volunteers were also present all day sharing how this organization helps maintain birding habitat on the Mississippi River. Sadly due to ongoing affects of the pandemic, the 2021and 2022 events have had to be cancelled. The 2023 is being planned for March 4.  All of the above programs and helpers will be included.</p>
<br><br><strong>3.2.6, Document that your community maintains a birding trail or hot spot location with educational signage and/or literature. (Note: A birding hotspot alone is not sufficient ï¿½ your community must actively promote birding and public education at the site itself.)</strong></strong></p><p>A double-sided bulletin board is redone each spring in Sugar Creek Park in Ferryville. This includes birding information for trails at Sugar Creek Bluff Natural Area, bird lists of birds that are in the area, and important birding information for visitors.  A fund-raising effort has been underway for the past three years to purchase new playground equipment for this park. This addition, was installed in the summer of 2020, and it has already greatly increased the number of visitors stopping at this park, and they will have access to the extensive birding information on this board. In addition to information about speciers of birds that are present in the area, hiking information is also on this board.  This is updated on a regular basis.  Our Facebook page also includes birding information especially about the tundra swan migration in the fall.</p></p>

Martin has extensive expertise in birding and has a master’s degree in natural sciences. He has conducted research in warblers and has worked tirelessly in updating this database for the birds of the Ferryville area. He used personal data as well as that from members of the Wisconsin Society for Ornithology, backyard bird counts, and Village of Ferryville residents. Martin has also been monitoring the blue bird success on Eagle Mountain, and has been compiling that information as well. Martin has moved from the area, but his extensive bird list is available and is  still being used and shared.</p>
<p>Ferryville has a village park maintained by the Village of Ferryville, and also a wildlife area managed by the Mississippi Valley Conservancy (MVC). The park is Sugar Creek Park, and the MVC property is the Sugar Creek Bluff State Natural Area. In the summer of 2015, the MVC added 144 acres to this bluff land natural area. The access to the addition has still not been finalized, but the original area is open daily for hiking and birding opportunities. The trail is maintained during the summer, and it is available in the winter for cross country skiing and snow shoeing. One of the species that has been observed on this property during the past three spring migration day hikes has been the Cerulean Warbler. Rush Creek Natural Area is just north of Ferryville and is managed by the Wisconsin DNR.  Bird lists have been kept for each birding hike. Christmas and Great Backyard birding lists and observations continue to be shared on e-bird by individuals.</p>
