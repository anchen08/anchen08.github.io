<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>In May of 2016, South Milwaukee adopted its 2035 Comprehensive Plan (<a href="http://www.smwi.org/172/Comprehensive-Plan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.smwi.org/172/Comprehensive-Plan</a>). The Plan is an update to the city’s 2020 plan adopted under Wisconsin’s 1999 comprehensive planning legislation, or “Smart Growth” legislation. The plan includes a detailed analysis of the City’s parks and natural areas and efforts to enhance those spaces. It also includes opportunities to more closely tie environmental considerations into the redevelopment of the city, including its brownfields. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ongoing Oak Creek Watershed Restoration Plan, an effort led by city officials in partnership with Milwaukee County, the Metropolitan Sewerage District, and various other governmental and advocacy groups to revitalize the 28 square-mile watershed behind environmental, ecological and recreational priorities. The study will include a detailed analysis of options to revitalize South Milwaukee’s Mill Pond and other bird habitats. The final report and plan is available as PDFs for downloading on the city's website: <a href="http://www.smwi.org/172/Comprehensive-Plan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.smwi.org/172/Comprehensive-Plan</a>.</li>
<li>The city’s development of a lakeshore park, a project that seeks to restore wetlands and open lakefront access to 18 acres of formerly contaminated land south of the South Milwaukee Wastewater Treatment Facility. The city continues to seek additional grant funding for this project, which is envisioned as a “passive park” to be developed over the next 10-20 years.</li>
<li>The city’s commitment to urban forestry. See Category 2.</li>

A Big Sit is a birding event that is fun for birders of all abilities. It has a picnic/tailgate feel to it. The goal of a big sit is to identify as many species of birds in a designated time frame. Every bird that is counted in the Big Sit must be observed from a 17 foot diameter circle. We will have at least one scope for sharing and a displayed dry erase board to write each species of bird seen and identified from the circle. Big Sits typically are a curious sight for nonbirders who often stop to ask what is going on, which gives the Big Sit participants the opportunity to explain the event, point out the list of birds on the list, and invite them to join. It is a great way to engage others, and folks can come and go as they please. We'll also supply extra binoculars, borrowed from the Wisconsin Metro Audubon, for those who need them. Mayor Erik Brooks will stop in to greet participants and acknowledge World Migratory Bird Day.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane44"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_44"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_44"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_delimiter cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_247"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_247" id="cblabcbfv_247"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong></strong></p><p>The <a href="http://smwi.org/birdcity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">City of South Milwaukee’s website</a> provides tips for creating a bird-friendly yard.

A group of about 12 volunteers each year dedicate their CBC hours to the South Milwaukee and surrounding eastern lakeshore area (Oak Creek, Cudahy, and Bay View). A lunch is provided each year at a South Milwaukee Home for all these volunteers. A separate gathering takes place at the Wehr Nature Center for the western area participants. COVID prevented the lunch gathering in 2020, but we hope it will return in 2021. The survey results from the South Milwaukee region are then sent to the Wehr Nature Center where it is combined with the results of the Hales Corners CBC Circle. A typical Hales Corners CBC tallies 60 species. Birds of interest have included Northern Shrike, Snowy Owl, Eastern Screech Owl, Great Black-backed gull, Bald Eagle, and a variety of winter ducks. On non-pandemic years when a gathering can take place, a dry erase board is set up at lunch where birders can add the species they've documented. This list is then shared on Facebook to create excitement and awareness of the Christmas Bird Count.</p><br><br><strong>3.6.2, Attach results from organized bird monitoring or data obtained from researchers or volunteers in the local park system.

The Mill Pond has had 118 species documented to date. </p>
