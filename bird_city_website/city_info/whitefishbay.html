<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>Whitefish Bay submitted a plan in 2009 that was accepted by the state and has been in compliance with Wisconsin’s Smart Growth law for planning and resource management since. The Village updated its comprehensive plan in Novemver 2019. The comprehensive plan include information about natural resources near and in Whitefish Bay including bird species. The plan encourages local groups to study the local presence of rare species and work with regional and state partners to develop + implement a plan that not only preserves existing rare species, but supports diversifying the local habitat in support of rare species. </p><br><br><strong>1.1.2, Document that current community planning seeks to provide additional bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>In 2020 and 2021,the Village worked with Whitefish Bay Garden Club on local pocket gardens/parks at Cahill Park, Marlborough Park and Village Library (bio-swale) for butterflies and birds.  Consaul Commons pocket park opened in 2022 with natural plantings. In 2022, hundreds of native plantings were placed at Silver Spring Park, Cahill Park and inside the roadway medians of Silver Spring Drive.</p>
<p>In 2023, the Fire Department parking lot will be replaced with permeable pavers and a bio-swale installation and native plantings on Hampton Avenue.

<h4>Limiting or Removing Threats to Birds</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>1.1.5, Demonstrate that your community understands the critical ecological role of pollinators by documenting your Bee City USA status or by describing another substantial effort to promote pollinator health (for ideas visit the Xerxes Society and the Pollinator Partnership)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.1.6, Show that your forester, a member of your tree board, or another person currently responsible for managing your community's trees has completed the Wisconsin DNR's Wisconsin Community Tree Management Institute</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>In 2019 the Whitefish Bay Garden club created a new rain garden and bioswale at Silver Spring Park. Bioswales provide landscaping create habitats for birds, butterflies, and local wildlife. They also reduce the overall runoff volume and flow rate which is received by the larger stormwater system. Bioswales are an aesthetically-pleasing alternative to concrete gutters and storm sewers, employing vegetated low-lying areas or troughs that use plant materials and specialized soil mixes to treat, absorb, and convey stormwater runoff.  Using a black geothermal fabric to remove invasive plants and limiting the need for harmful chemicals. In 2021, the Whitefish Bay Garden club finalized the bioswale and natrual planting area at Silver Spring Park. A walking path was created for people to learn about plants, birds, and insects. Educational signage in the park allow for patrons to scan QR codes with their cell phones. Large educational signs explain bio-swales and raingarden in the park, in addition to the QR codes.  An education campaign will display on the phone which demonstrates which native plants people may choose to plan at their homes.  More than 650 plants representing more than 42 species were planted in the park.  </p>
<p>The Whitefish Bay Public library has a natural planting seed bank for residents to help restore bird habitats on thier personal property. The Library also has the natural bio-swale with native plantings. </p>

The focus of the day was to create a healthier environment for birds by promoting an awareness of bird migration, native plants and composting for turf, gardens and birdhouses. The official poster of WMBD was handed out to children. The theme in 2019 involved was the reduction of plastic use. The Whitefish Bay Garden Club created posters creating awareness of single use plastics.  This helped by not using single use water bottles and plastic bags. There was also a raffle reusable mesh bags for produce and reusable storage containers to reduce use of cling wrap  Members spoke about the importance of providing healthy materials for bird nesting and lists of recommended materials were provided for creating a bird friendly environments in the back yard. The nesting bags included all natural materials. Children were encouraged to make their own bags. Feedback from those who utilized the bags was positive and individuals indicated that it was enjoyable to witness the birds using the nesting bags. In 2020, Bay Day was cancelled as a result of COVID-19, however the Village did place articles in newsletter and Bay Leaves about plastic use. In 2021 and 2022, the Village and the Garden Club partnered to hand out natural plantings as part of a moblie Bay Day event.  </p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="cbTabPane tab-pane cbTabPaneMenu" id="cbtabpane43"><div class="cb_tab_content cb_tab_menu" id="cb_tabid_43"><div class="cbFieldsContentsTab" id="cbtf_43"><div class="form-group row no-gutters sectiontableentry2 cbft_gallery cb_form_line cbtwolinesfield" id="cbfr_245"><label class="col-form-label col-sm-12" for="cbfv_245" id="cblabcbfv_245"><br><br><strong>3.2.1, Provide web links or a community newsletter demonstrating that your community educates property owners on methods to create and enhance backyard habitat for birds</strong></strong></p><p>The Village <a href="http://www.wfbvillage.org/241/Bird-City-of-Wisconsin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> includes information for enhancing backyard habitat for birds and links to Bird City and other national organizations.  The Garden Club provides articles in the Village Newsletter and Bay Leaves that help promote this issue as well. </p><br><br><strong>3.2.2, Attach a state publication showing that there is a segment of the Great Wisconsin Birding and Nature Trail or a designated Important Bird Area within or adjacent to your community</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.2.3, Demonstrate that your community actively raises awareness of its bird assets.
