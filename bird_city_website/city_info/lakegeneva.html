Over the last 40 years the Conservancy has protected more than 2,000 acres through conservation easements and land donations. The Conservancy also works with other public and private organizations to acquire and protect land with high conservation value in priority areas. They advocate through educational programs on such topics as birds, and oak tree preservation, as well as programs encouraging native plantings for monarch and pollinator species. The Conservancy is dedicated to ecology, the preservation of open space and the history of our natural spaces. The Conservancy directs its efforts toward shaping zoning policies and decisions, public and private land conservation, and environmental education. Gathering Waters, the Wisconsin’s Alliance for Land Trusts, named the Geneva Lake Conservancy the Wisconsin Land Trust of the Year in 2020. </p>
<p>In 2021 the Geneva Lake Conservancy acquired an additional 61 acres of farmland whose donors had worked to restore some of the cropland to prairie and wetlands, and who, together with the GLC, envision full restoration of the land to native ecosystems. In 2022 they accepted 12.5 donation near Lake Como which will provide a habitat for a variety of wildlife including birds. The property is closed to hiking and is maintained as a wildlife preserve with public access only by guided tour. Lake Como is adjacent to Lake Geneva. In addition, the GLC worked with a land foundation to protect 60 acres of organic farm land in Walworth County with conservation easements that ensure that this prime agricultural land will be preserved.</p>
<p>The Geneva Lake Conservancy also began a “Conservation@Home” program to help educate and activate landowners to make eco-healthy choices in their home landscape that are critical to the health of resident and migratory birds.  <em> </em></p>
<p>One of the areas preserved by the Conservancy is Bromley Woods  This has been the site of the Conservancy's bi-annual bird walks. </p>

This informs boaters of ways to avoid bringing invasive species into Geneva Lake. The water quality of the lake influences the health of fish, insects, and plants that are critical for the preservation of habitat and food sources for a wide variety of birds - including various species of Duck, Swfits, Loons, Merganzers, Coots, and Raptors. Citizens can also contact the arborist for help with the identification and removal of invasive plants.  </p>
<p>In addition, a consortium of conservation-minded, non-profit groups banded together in 2021 to purchase and deploy a boat-washing station to help reduce the introduction of invasive species in Geneva Lake.  Please see 2022 Reports by going to to the Geneva Lake Enviromental Agency at <a href="https://birdcitywisconsin.org/gleawi.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gleawi.org</a></p><br><br><strong>1.4.2, Demonstrate that your community offers a program for private property owners who are interested in dealing with invasive plants that have significant negative impacts on bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Lake Geneva is very concerned about invasive shrubs and plants and their encroachment into wooded areas. To that effect, the City has established several ways for residents to get information on how to control the spread of invasive plants and shrubs. The City provides information on its <a href="https://www.cityoflakegeneva.com/?SEC=3F6010E6-8410-42AF-B6B6-340DDD865C34" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> under "Prevent the Spread" which links to the WDNR’s <a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Invasives/prevention.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent resources</a> on invasive species.

One, the chimney at the Geneva Lake Museum, attracts thousands of Chimney Swifts on an annual basis. This has been the site of the City's Swift Night Out event for the past decade.  When the City found that the other chimney (Water Department) had been capped, this was uncapped for the swifts. A third chimney in a local church also serves as a Chimney Swift roost.  In 2020, an additional nesting chimney was identified at a retail shop in downtown Lake Geneva.

The Avian Committee was awarded a WE Energies grant and worked to obtain matching funds from volunteers who solicited donations. This allowed the purchase of state-of-the-art Purple Martin houses. The Committee partnered with researcher Dick Nikolai of the Wisconsin Purple Martin Association, an expert on Purple Martin breeding and behavior and a retired Wisconsin DNR wildlife biologist, to research, buy, and site these houses. A core of volunteers was recruited to monitor the houses and collect data, interact with and educate residents and tourists, and participate in various community education programs. Both Nikolai and Helen Pugh, from the Hoy Audubon Society, educated volunteers in state-of-the-art management techniques for the new colony. Nikolai also worked with the volunteers to band the fledglings.  In 2022, the City of Lake Geneva Avian Committee members and volunteers continue to monitor the colony and to look for birds banded in 2019.   The volunteer nest keepers have gained knowledge and experience with this colony and, with the advice of experts, have determined that grouping houses attracts more nesting pairs to the colony. Therefore, several houses were relocated to enhance the colony along the lakeshore path.  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;">The first year the houses were in place, 2018, twenty-three birds fledged from the new colony nests. In 2022, that number had grown to 115.  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;">The colony is thriving.  In the photo section, please see <em>Category 1Q - 2022 Purple Martin nesting pair at colony house.</em></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;"> Volunteers who manage houses along the lakeshore path - a high foot traffic area - take time to speak with, and educate, residents and visitors about the City’s Purple Martin Colony project. Since volunteers monitor the houses multiple times per week, this provided the opportunity for many interactions with residents and visitors. Outreach to the public continued even when volunteers were not present, through interpretative signage. The City of Lake Geneva Avian Committee, with the support of city leadership and the assistance of the Public Works Department, purchased, sited, and installed one interpretive sign near the Public Library. In 2021 a second sign was added on the lakeshore path and near three Purple Martin houses. Information on the colony and on Purple Martin conservation was also posted on the Avian Committee's Facebook page.  Please see photo <em>Category 1T - One of two Purple Martin interpretive signs.</em></span><em>.  </em></p>
<p>In 2022, the Avian Committee participated in the Lake Geneva Public Library's Author Fest where they shared information about Purple Martins.This educational outreach included guided tours of the houses, resources at the library which included books and bird watching kits, and also promoted family visits to Four Seasons Nature Preserve which showcases the Storybook Trail featuring purple martins. In the photo section please see <em>Category 1Q - Purple Martin Educational Poster</em>. </p>
<p>Committee members and volunteers also encouraged private property owners to install Purple Martin houses. During visits, these members and volunteers assisted residents in house management and monitoring.  In the photo section, please see <em>Category 1Q - Private Purple Martin House along the lakeshore.</em></p><br><br><strong>2.1.1, Describe your community's educational program to control free-roaming cats and/or the manner in which you actively publicize the Cats Indoors initiative</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Lake Geneva has a <a href="https://www.cityoflakegeneva.com/?SEC=29643B71-B7C6-4E82-9E85-0C0B2451BDDF" rel="noopener" target="_blank">web page</a> dedicated to Dog and Cat Owner Responsibility and also displays this information in handouts available in the City Hall Lobby. This information explains the City’s ordinance that requires that all cats be either indoors or safely confined.  Dog and cat leash laws are enforced in a cooperative effort by several city departments. All street department personnel, utility personnel, police personnel, fire personnel and the code enforcement officer are asked to report any loose dogs or cats to the Code Enforcement Officer. The animals are then caught, and either taken to the Walworth County animal rescue shelter or returned to the owner if there is a license tag on the animal and it has had its shots. The first time, the owners are warned and if the animal is caught again, a ticket will be issued</p>
<p>In addition to the City’s information and code enforcement, the City of Lake Geneva Avian Committee has developed educational materials about the need to keep cats indoors for both Brownies and Junior Girl Scouts.  As part of badge requirements, both levels of Girl Scouts researched and developed posters to communicate to their neighbors about the need to keep cats indoors.  Please see the photo in <em>Category 3A –  Brownies - How to be a bird buddy</em></p><br><br><strong>2.1.2, Document a program that effectively reduces feral cat populations (Note: See 3F for enforced ordinances).

<p>The City website provides links to the American Bird Conservancy and notes the following,"As part of our strategic conservation framework, we tackle the biggest threats to birds. When it comes to bird collisions, we work with manufacturers to develop bird-safe glass and provide easy solutions for homeowners. We push for wind turbines and associated power lines and towers to be placed in areas that minimize impacts on federally protected birds."  [<a href="https://www.cityoflakegeneva.com/index.asp?SEC=6F2240C6-4E0A-434F-A5F8-CC015943DF1A&amp;DE=8A02DA91-FA77-49DD-9DF8-707DD56F5C83&amp;Type=B_BASIC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">City of Lake Geneva website link - bird collision information</a>]. </p>
<p>Part of the public outreach and educational efforts of the Avian Committee of Lake Geneva was to develop materials to work with Brownies and Junior Girl Scouts on bird-related badges.  As part of the curriculum created by the committee, both the Brownies and Junior Girl Scouts are required to research ways to help protect birds and create a means to assist them in communicating this information to others.  A required part of that message was ways that they could equip others to help prevent bird-window strikes.  In the photo section, please see an example of a poster that the Junior Girl Scouts created, <em>Category 3B - Junior Girl Scout poster showing ways to limit bird-window strikes.  </em>Also in the photo section, please see<em> </em><em>Category 3B – Cords to prevent window strikes - Avian Committee members demonstrating this for Brownies.  </em>This photo shows two committee members, Kelley Happ and Jill Rodriguez, demonstrating how to hang cords on windows to prevent bird strikes.</p><br><br><strong>2.2.2, Demonstrate that your community has enacted a bird collision monitoring program and has treated problem windows to reduce collisions with municipal and commercial buildings</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.2.3, Document that a municipal or major public building has been awarded LEED certification as a bird-friendly building (LEED SSpc 55)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.2.4, Document that your community has registered a municipal building(s) in the Wisconsin Humane Society's WIngs BirdSafe Business program AND show that this building has made an effort to reduce window collisions (see ï¿½Things that can be done at businessesï¿½)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.2.5, Attach your community's ordinance that requires new buildings to be built following bird-safe design, construction, and operation guidelines (e.g., Toronto Green Standard, see Ecology: Bird Deterrence; San Francisco)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>2.3.1, Document that your community operates a significant Lights Out program that dims building lights to reduce collisions during spring and fall migration or that you have an outdoor lighting ordinance that includes Lights Out during bird migration</strong></strong></p><p>In 2022 the Avian Committee continued its Learning to Soar educational programming as an interdisciplinary classroom and field experience, but also expanded to other youth groups, as noted in Section 4.E.  These additional educational programs, such as the Brownie "Bird Buddy" badge and the "Beautiful Birds" program were designed based on learning objectives for lower elementary grades.  The Learning to Soar curriculum continues to be a semster-long multi-disciplinary course mapped to fifth-grade learning objectives (see curriculum describtion below).  This is the fourth year that this program has been implemented.  In 2019 members of the Avian Committee in concert with a local educator, Ms. Jill Lorenzi, created a cross-disciplinary, bird-focused curriculum for fifth graders - Learning to Soar.  The curriculum is designed to equip students with information and skills across multiple disciplines.  Using these tools, these citizen scientists will research and use critical thinking skills to understand the complex relationships between humans and birds, and how humans’ actions impact birds’ ability to thrive.  The program was piloted in that year with eighteen students.  Pre and post-testing indicated significant, positive progress in all learning objectives.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;">In 2022, as Covid protocols were relaxed, Avian Committee members, volunteers, and subject matter experts were able to be in the classroom with more frequency to mentor students.  Mentors led traditional classes and experiential learning exercises, such as the Migratory Bird Game, in the photo section please see <em>Category 4A.  Learning to Soar Student "flocks" participating in the 2022 Migratory Bird Game.</em></span></p>

<p>Learning objectives for the Learning to Soar Program were mapped for each lesson to cover the following Wisconsin 5th grade standards:  Science, (Life Science, (Cross-cutting Concepts, Science &amp; Engineering Practice &amp; Earth Science), English Language Arts (Reading Information Texts, Speaking and Listening), and Math (Measurement and Data).  Lesson worksheets provide formative assessments on one or two standards and tests provide more comprehensive summative assessments.  In the documents section, please see <em>Category 4A - City of Lake Geneva - Learning to Soar Curriculum Overview.</em>  The lessons cover the following.</p>
<p>Unit 1.  Bird Basics:  How do birds make a living?</p>
<p>This unit has five knowledge and skill-building lessons and two engaged learning lessons (to prepare for an engaged learning exercise).  The mission of these lessons is to build the students’ understanding of the basic biology of birds and the necessary internal processes and external resources that are necessary for birds to survive.  This equips the students with the necessary background to move into the higher order research and reasoning necessary to complete a capstone project.  Engaged Learning Exercises for Unit 1 are integrated into the course plan to coincide with The Great Backyard Bird Count (February) or another bird-watching event.   </p>
<p>Unit 2.  Focus on Migratory Birds</p>
<p>This unit has two lessons focused on migratory birds.  Migratory birds provide a basis for introducing complexity into research and modeling (climate, transnational ecosystems/ agriculture/laws/cultures/economies, physics, and risk models). </p>
<p>Unit 3. Working as a Citizen Scientist</p>
<p>This unit is designed to build the students’ ability to research and integrate information into a cohesion physical and oral presentation.  The structure of the assignment includes common components that can be mentored in a full-class setting, and employs volunteer coaches (ratio 1 coach to 4 students) who serve as mentors to the students and provide structured feedback to the teacher on progress and problems.  This unit can result in a capstone project that is either a project-based learning experience for the entire class or an individual research project for each student.  With the assistance of volunteer coaches and local experts (from entities such as the Lakeland Audubon Society and the Geneva Lake Conservancy), the students either produce a "bird fair" exhibit or a storybook trail.</p>
<p>The capstone project for the class for 2022 - as noted earlier in this section - was the creation of a Storybook Trail at the Four Seasons Nature Preserve.  The story for 2022 was "The Martins Find a Home."  The student-authors told the story of a Purple Martin family that migrated to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin and settled in the Four Seasons Nature Preserve to raise their babies.  The story is told in nine "pages" or trail signs, which relate to the nature features and bird houses in the preserve.</p><br><br><strong>2.4.1, Show how your community regulates communication tower construction, siting, and lighting to mitigate their risk to migrating birds</strong></strong></p><p>Most communication antennas in Lake Geneva are on city-owned water towers. There are few free-standing towers. Lake Geneva’s zoning does permit towers in the industrial park areas as a conditional use. However, the City has never received an application to construct such a tower. While it is illegal to ban communication towers, this conditional-use-process would make it significantly more difficult to construct a tower in Lake Geneva.</p>
<p>Using information provided by Bird City Wisconsin, Brian Lenz, the Committee provided consultation to the Lake Geneva YMCA to inform the planning and design of the building of a new facility.  This was appropriate given that the plans called for extensive glass windows and the building site is adjacent to a natural area.</p><br><br><strong>2.5.1, Show that your municipality practices Integrated Pest Management, using natural pest control and the best available science to minimize pesticide and herbicide use</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.1.1, Document and describe your event that incorporates the annual WMBD theme in some fashion.

<p>In May 2022, as the capstone project for the Learning to Soar educational program, the fifth-grade students from St. Francis de Sales Elementary School presented their gift to the community - a Storybook Trail at the Four Seasons Nature Preserve.  More than 100 people attended the event. Joining students, parents, and school principal and school staff, community members, and members of supporting and funding groups attended.<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;"> Lake Geneva alderperson John Halverson spoke on behalf of the mayor and city council.  Members of the board of the Environmental Education Foundation, the President , Stephanie Klett,  of Visit Lake Geneva and members of her executive team, Tree Board members,city arborist Jon Foster, Park Board Commissioners, Geneva Lake Conservancy Executives,  joined City of Lake Geneva Avian Committee members to celebrate this new bird-focused resource. The event was publizied throughout the county which resulted in a feature article in local news media.  In the photo section please see <em>Category 6B - 2022 World Migratory Bird Day - Storybook Trail Launch - group shot with students and visitors, Category 6B - 2022 World Migratory Bird Day - Councilperson Halverson and EEF Board Member reading sign.</em></span></p>
<p>Since the trail was designed to get young readers interested in birds, perhaps the most important guests at the lauch were the second grade students.  The highlight of the event was the "test-drive" by the children.  Groups of fifth-graders guided the younger students around the trail, helping them read the signs, do the activities (like looking for bird nests), and introducing them to the "brillant bird facts" noted on the signs.  In the photo section, please see Category 6B - 2022 Student creators touring younger children around the Storybook Trail and <em>Category 6B - 2022 Helping young readers interpret the Storybook Trail signs</em>.

It provides habitat for 109 species of concern that include federal and state threatened and endangered species. It was officially established in 2012 and the first segment was open to the public in 2019. The Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge boundary employs a cores and corridors concept for wildlife preservation with a focus on migratory and grassland birds.</p>
<p>As the refuge continues to grow, the staff and volunteers are working to connect conserved land in southeast Wisconsin and northeast Illinois, linking lands conserved by local, county, and state agencies and private organizations. The mission is to restore and connect a landscape that includes large blocks of grasslands, wet prairies, and natural stream watercourses.In addition, a designated birding area is associated with Hackmatack in Peterkin Pond, </p>
<p>The White River County Park is Walworth County’s newest and largest park. The 195-acre farm was acquired in 2012  It is located near Lake Geneva and has two miles of frontage on the White River. The county is partnering with the Geneva Lake Conservancy and other local groups to restore this prime acquisition to its native prairie, forest and wetlands. This park provides critical habitat for resident and migratory birds.  Visitors are encouraged to go birding and use trail maps, like the one provided in the documents section, <em>Category 1G - White River Birding Trail Map</em>, equip visitors with information on birds they are likley to see in the park.  These include Meadowlarks, Goldfinch, a variety of ducks, Red-winged Blackbirds, and a growing number of Bald Eagles.</p><br><br><strong>3.2.3, Demonstrate that your community actively raises awareness of its bird assets. Examples include placing a remote web camera on a nest platform; offering regular, public bird-watching field trips; or creating a significant educational resource on your community's birdlife</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.2.4, Provide a link to your community's Bird City Wisconsin webpage, which must be visible from the main page of your municipal website (it may be located at the first level of a drop-down menu on the main page but cannot be any less visible) OR demonstrate that your Bird City effort has a significant social media presence</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.2.5, Describe your community-sponsored annual bird festival. This must be a multi-day event or a truly exceptional one-day event</strong></strong></p><p>Each year for the past decade, the City of Lake Geneva Avian Committee, in conjunction with the Geneva Lake Museum presents an annual Swift Night Out Program to help raise awareness and encourage interest in Chimney Swifts. Lake Geneva is fortunate to have large populations of Chimney Swifts that migrate through each fall, as well as several tall chimneys, notably at the Geneva Lake Museum, that serve as overnight stops for large flocks for several weeks in September.  The chimney at the Geneva Lake Museum is a traditional gathering place for thousands of these birds as they migrate.  This event is a one-night event where at dusk, at the conclusion of the indoor informational program, everyone goes outside as thousands of these acrobatic birds descend into the chimney.</p>
<p>In 2023, the Avian committee invited Schlitz Audubon back again to present their wonderful Raptor program “Eagle and Friends” at the Lake Geneva Swift Night Out. Since the program would occur over dinnertime, food trucks and picnic tables were made available throughout the evening. Avian committee member Dr. Carol Zimmermann gave an introductory talk on the Chimney Swifts, stressing the vital importance of preserving these local chimneys for their migration. All audience members were provided with an information sheet on Chimney Swifts. This introduction was followed by the Schlitz Audubon’s raptor program which thrilled the audience with four live raptors, including a magnificent eagle. At dusk everyone was encouraged to gather outside the museum.  A great deal of interest in Swifts had been generated as 2 years ago year the swifts did not show up at the museum chimney and then this year a cold front occured the night before the program. The committe had been montitoring the chimney during the week but it was feared that the Swifts might have left with the sudden change of weather. Dr. Zimmermann warned the crowd of this possibility and she had prepared a "Plan B" talk in case this happened. This uncertainty created much anticipation for the onlookers as to whether or not Swifts would show up at the museum this year. Fortunately the Swifts did not dissappoint and a cheer went up from the crowd as the spectacle of thousands of swifts started to gather and applause broke out as the final Swifts decended into the large chimney.  In the photo section, please see <em>Category 4D - 2022 Swift Night Out - Eagle - Schlitz Audubon presentation.</em></p>
<p>The  public had been invited through flyers, Facebook posts, and newspaper articles. Our partner entities- Lake Geneva Museum, Lakeland Audubon, the Public Library of Lake Geneva, Visit Lake Geneva, the City’s Tourism Commission, as well as local businesses, helped promote this event through the museum's electronic sign, social media, flyers, and yard signs. Despite the challenges posed by the weather and the lack of Swifts in past years, the event was very successful, attracting more than 300 people to the museum.  In the documents section, please see<em> Category 4D - 2023 Swift Night Out promotional material - two-sided rack cards </em>and<em> Category 4D - Chimney Swift information sheet.</em></p><br><br><strong>3.2.6, Document that your community maintains a birding trail or hot spot location with educational signage and/or literature. (Note: A birding hotspot alone is not sufficient ï¿½ your community must actively promote birding and public education at the site itself.)</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Lake Geneva Avian Committee has partnered with other city committees and conservation groups to create two birding trails in the city. As noted in Section 1P, one trail is found along the City’s Lakeshore Path. This trail features two interpretive signs and various informal “tours” of the Purple Martin colony lead by volunteer nest-keepers. The second interpretive sign was funded, sited, and installed in 2021 near three active Purple Martin houses as part of the Avian Committee's public education and outreach about this expanding colony. Please see the photo section for <em>Category 1T - One of two Purple Martin interpretive signs.</em>  The Avian Committee, along with the Public Library of Lake Geneva, and funding partners Alliant Energy Foundation and Simple Bakery and Market also provided birding hotspot maps and literature in the Alliant Energy Bird-watching Kits, available for free check-out at the public library. This project is explained in greater depth in Category 4L.  Residents and visitors along the lakeshore path can use the binoculars and bird identification materials in the kits to spot birds from the Purple Martin Colony, but also a host of birds who flock to the lake as summer residents or as migrants.  In the photo section, please see <em>Category 1T - Purple Martins gathered on the Lake Geneva Pier sign</em> and <em>Category 1T - Bonaparte Gulls gathered at a lakefront pier.</em></p>
<p>In addition, the Avian committee added educational signage at the Four Seasons Nature Preserve. When this trail was created signage was placed along the trail that informed walkers about the native plants and trees that are found in the preserve, and the animals, insects, and birds that rely on these natives for food and habitat. These signs are geared for adults.<br/>In 2021 and 2022, with the mentoring of Avian Committee members, fifth-graders at a local school created a story-book trail aimed at young children and families. Each of the nine signs lead the walker around one of the trails. On each sign the students display one page of the story that they wrote about a bird family that migrates to the preserve, along with a fun fact about the birds and the flora at the preserve, and one activity to do at that spot (such as look for a nest or birdhouse).<br/>Also in 2022,  with the assistance of the city arborist,  the avain committee added educational posters along with introductory materials in the large, permanent, weather-resistant display signs at the trailhead. These materials include a map to introduce the trail, a poster noting the Bird City designation for the city, and pictorial posters of native Midwestern birds and plants so that visitors can anticipate encountering while walking and visiting the preserve.  In the photo section, please see <em>Category 1T - Dedication and map for the Storybook Trail at Four Seasons Nature Preserve, Category 1T - Signage at the entrance to Four Seasons Nature Preserve, and </em><em>Category 1T - Example showing the content of one of the Storybook Trail signs at Four Seasons Nature Preserve.</em></p></p>

<p><br><br><strong>3.2.7, Document that a municipal building has significant bird-friendly landscaping that features native plants AND signage that explains the importance of native plants and providing diverse habitat for birds (e.g., brush piles, water features)</strong></strong></p><p>The Public Library of Lake Geneva has a garden of native, perennial plants. This garden was developed by Northwinds Perennial Farm.  The signage in the garden explains the benefit of native plants. Information includes, "This garden will be visited by large numbers of pollinators, moths, butterflies, bees, and diverse seasonal bird activity, providing food and material for nest building." In the photo section, please see <em>Category 4J - Native Plant Gardens at Lake Geneva Public Library.</em></p><br><br><strong>3.3.1, Document a substantial regular program that educates young people on any of the following topics: climate change, energy efficiency, green/bird-safe buildings, or environmental sustainability</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.3.2, Demonstrate that schools in your community participate in a nationally recognized environmental education program (e.g., Flying WILD, Audubon Adventures) or that your community organizes its own substantial education and outreach program for young people</strong></strong></p><p>In 2022 the Avian Committee continued its Learning to Soar educational programming as an interdisciplinary classroom and field experience, but also expanded to other youth groups, as noted in Section 4.E.  These additional educational programs, such as the Brownie "Bird Buddy" badge and the "Beautiful Birds" program were designed based on learning objectives for lower elementary grades.  The Learning to Soar curriculum continues to be a semster-long multi-disciplinary course mapped to fifth-grade learning objectives (see curriculum describtion below).  This is the fourth year that this program has been implemented.  In 2019 members of the Avian Committee in concert with a local educator, Ms. Jill Lorenzi, created a cross-disciplinary, bird-focused curriculum for fifth graders - Learning to Soar.  The curriculum is designed to equip students with information and skills across multiple disciplines.  Using these tools, these citizen scientists will research and use critical thinking skills to understand the complex relationships between humans and birds, and how humans’ actions impact birds’ ability to thrive.  The program was piloted in that year with eighteen students.  Pre and post-testing indicated significant, positive progress in all learning objectives.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;">In 2022, as Covid protocols were relaxed, Avian Committee members, volunteers, and subject matter experts were able to be in the classroom with more frequency to mentor students.  Mentors led traditional classes and experiential learning exercises, such as the Migratory Bird Game, in the photo section please see <em>Category 4A.  Learning to Soar Student "flocks" participating in the 2022 Migratory Bird Game.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;"><em>For the capstone project</em></span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;"> the students created a Storybook Trail at the city's Four Seasons Nature Preserve.  Mentors from the Avian Committee, Lakeland Audubon Society, the Public Library, the Geneva Lake Conservancy, and a local artist and the city arborist all assisted by virtually meeting with the students for research and classroom work and then meeting the students outside for site research.  In the photo section, please see </span><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;">Category 4A - Research visit to Four Seasons Nature Preserve. </em><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;"> <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;"> This capstone was created to provide a project-based, collaborative learning experience that blended in-class work with outdoor exploration and education.  This process introduced students, staff, and parents to community and governmental groups focused on conservation.</span></span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;"> worked in teams to create an original story about a bird that migrates to the perserve, illustrate that story, and link an activity  and a "bird fact" to each page of the story.  Avian Committee members served as the "clients" for this project-based learning experience.  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;">Please see the documents section for an overview of the project-based learning requirements for the capstone,</span><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;"> Category 4A - Client Requirements - Storybook Trail 2022. </em></span></p>
<p>Learning objectives for the Learning to Soar Program were mapped for each lesson to cover the following Wisconsin 5th grade standards:  Science, (Life Science, (Cross-cutting Concepts, Science &amp; Engineering Practice &amp; Earth Science), English Language Arts (Reading Information Texts, Speaking and Listening), and Math (Measurement and Data).  Lesson worksheets provide formative assessments on one or two standards and tests provide more comprehensive summative assessments.  In the documents section, please see <em>Category 4A - City of Lake Geneva - Learning to Soar Curriculum Overview.</em>  The lessons cover the following.</p>
<p>Unit 1.  Bird Basics:  How do birds make a living?</p>
<p>This unit has five knowledge and skill-building lessons and two engaged learning lessons (to prepare for an engaged learning exercise).  The mission of these lessons is to build the students’ understanding of the basic biology of birds and the necessary internal processes and external resources that are necessary for birds to survive.  This equips the students with the necessary background to move into the higher order research and reasoning necessary to complete a capstone project.  Engaged Learning Exercises for Unit 1 are integrated into the course plan to coincide with The Great Backyard Bird Count (February) or another bird-watching event.   </p>
<p>Unit 2.  Focus on Migratory Birds</p>
<p>This unit has two lessons focused on migratory birds.  Migratory birds provide a basis for introducing complexity into research and modeling (climate, transnational ecosystems/ agriculture/laws/cultures/economies, physics, and risk models). </p>
<p>Unit 3. Working as a Citizen Scientist</p>
<p>This unit is designed to build the students’ ability to research and integrate information into a cohesion physical and oral presentation.  The structure of the assignment includes common components that can be mentored in a full-class setting, and employs volunteer coaches (ratio 1 coach to 4 students) who serve as mentors to the students and provide structured feedback to the teacher on progress and problems.  This unit can result in a capstone project that is either a project-based learning experience for the entire class or an individual research project for each student.  With the assistance of volunteer coaches and local experts (from entities such as the Lakeland Audubon Society and the Geneva Lake Conservancy), the students either produce a "bird fair" exhibit or a storybook trail.</p>
<p>The capstone project for the class for 2022 - as noted earlier in this section - was the creation of a Storybook Trail at the Four Seasons Nature Preserve.  The story for 2022 was "The Martins Find a Home."  The student-authors told the story of a Purple Martin family that migrated to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin and settled in the Four Seasons Nature Preserve to raise their babies.  The story is told in nine "pages" or trail signs, which relate to the nature features and bird houses in the preserve.</p><br><br><strong>3.3.3, Show how your community aids a local youth group (e.g., Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of USA, 4-H Club, etc.) or conservation group in bird-conservation projects (e.g., bluebird trail, habitat restoration, Wood Duck nest boxes, etc.)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.3.4, Show that your municipality promotes and supports a bird club or other environmentally/ecologically minded club. (Exclusions: garden clubs, unless you demonstrate a strong focus on native plants)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>3.4.1, Show that your community works with traditionally underserved communities to increase their access to natural areas, environmental education, birding resources, and local environmental experts</strong></strong></p><p>With the support of a grant from the Alliant Energy Foundation, the City of Lake Geneva Avian Committee assembled six bird-watching backpacks. These backpacks include binoculars, a bird identification book, a diary for recording observations, and a special city-specific birding hotspot map. The Public Library of Lake Geneva volunteered strong support for the program by housing and lending the backpacks to any resident or visitor. The Lakelake Audubon Society provided technical assistance and advice on the components of the kit. This is a <strong>no-cost resource</strong> available to any family or individual. To continue to build knowledge about - and use of - this free resource, the Avian Committee also integrated the use of the back-packs into outreach efforts with public and private schools and with on bird walks with groups such as the Girl Scouts.  For a picture of the bird-watching kits in action, please see the photo from <em>Category 4E - Junior Girl Scouts on a bird watching walk.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;">The popularity of the Bird-Watching Kits and the partnership with the Public Library of Lake Geneva inspired activity to improve the backpacks. The Avian Committee used funds to help purchase bird books and materials to teach beginning readers (pre-school to second grade) about birds. These materials, as well as programs using the materials, are a free service of the Public Library of Lake Geneva.  In the photo section, please see </span><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; caret-color: auto;">Category 4L - Avian Committee members joining public library staff to present bird-related resources and  information to young readers.</em></p></p>

<h4>World Migratory Bird Day (WMBD)</h4>
<p></p>
<p><br><br><strong>3.5.1, Illustrate a program that involves schools, garden clubs, or other organizations in bird-conservation activities</strong></strong></p><p> In 2022, the Avian Committee honored the local Girl Scouts Brownie Troup as they were awarded their "Bird Buddy" badges.  Brownies are allowed to create a special interest badge for their troop.  The City of Lake Geneva Avian Committee created the learning objectives and activities for a bird-focused badge and mentored the young ladies through that curriculum.  In the photo section, please see <em>Category 4E - Brownies awarded Bird Buddy badges and certification by Avian Committee Members.</em></p>
<p> The Avian Committee also partnered with the local conservation association, the Geneva Lake Conservancy.  Together the organizations created and presented a special program for families titled, "Beautiful Birds."  The program engaged children and their families in activities that taught them how to recognize birds.  Families played games to learn about the relationship between birds and their natural environment, including the food that natural areas provide to help birds thrive.  In the photo section, please see <em>Category 4E - Young scientists learn about bird beaks adapted to food sources.</em>  As part of this program, and many others hosted by the Geneva Lake Conservancy (GLC) - children and families learn about the critical relationship of birds and natural areas.  The summer 2022 program was held at a local Conservancy site.  In the documents section, please see <em>Category 4E- Article in the Geneva Lake Conservancy newsletter.  </em>This article highlights  the joint efforts of the Avian Committee and the GLC to inspire and equip families to protect natural areas for the benefit of birds...and all animals and humans.</p>
<p>The Geneva Lake Museum has been a valued partner and has joined with the Avian Committee of Lake Geneva in sponsoring public engagement and educational programs (including hosting events such as Swift Night Out and informational presentations by Avian Committee members or organized by the committee).  In 2022, the Museum once again hosts a "Parade of Trees."  This annual event is promoted by the Museum (and participating organizations) on social media and newsletters.  The mission of the event is two-fold: to help non-profit organizations get the message out about their causes and to raise money for local charities.  This year (2022) the Avian Committee has once again joined in this event, decorating a "Bird Tree" to promote avian education in the community.  In the photo section please see <em>Category 4E - 2022 Parade of Trees - Avian Committee "bird tree."</em></p><br><br><strong>3.6.1, Demonstrate that your community is represented in at least one citizen science bird-monitoring program (e.g., the Christmas Bird Count, Great Backyard Bird Count, Swift Night Out)</strong></strong></p><p>In 2022 the Avian Committee equipped elementary students to participate in the Great Backyard Bird Count.  Avian Committee members taught Learning to Soar students the basics of bird watching and bird identification.  The students also learned how to input bird counts into eBird and why scientists, scholars, bird advocates, and policy-makers depend on citizen scientists and the information that people (just like them) record and enter into the database.</p>
<p>Students were also provided with field manuals to record their sightings, bird indentification posters, seed packets, and QR codes to take them to virtual resources including All About Birds and the online Audubon field guide.   </p>
<p>This year was students recorded more birds and sightings than in any previous year.  These citizen scientists recorded sightings of 154 birds and 21 different species.  In the photo section please see <em>Category 4C - 2022 Backyard Bird Count - seed packets and bird identification materials </em>and<em> i</em>n the documents section please see<em> Category 4C - Record of eBird sightings during the Great Backyard Bird Count.</em></p>
<p>The local Audubon Chapter,  Lakeland Audubon Society, has been conducting a Christmas Bird Count for many years. The 2022 count runs from mid-December 2022 through January 5.  The count circle is centered about two miles west of the city.  Local bird watchers general record more than 50 different species, including Northern Flicker, Brown Creeper and Common Redpoll.  In addition, Lakeland also held eagle walks to monitor the growing Bald Eagle population in our region.  Details can be found by going visiting the Lakeland Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count webpage at <a href="https://www.audubon.org/conservation/join-christmas-bird-count" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lakeland Audubon Society  Christmas Bird Count</a></p><br><br><strong>3.6.2, Attach results from organized bird monitoring or data obtained from researchers or volunteers in the local park system.
