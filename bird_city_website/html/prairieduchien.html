<strong>1.1.1, Comply with Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" law for land use planning and resource management. This criterion is an option only for applications submitted before July 1, 2017</strong></strong></p><p>The City of Prairie du Chien adopted a comprehensive plan in 2004. The City refers to the guidelines of the plan for any development activities. Goal 22 (Page B-28) describes how the city will protect natural resources and environmentally sensitive land from inappropriate use and development. Among the policies cited are "...protect rare and endangered species and maintain their habitat" and "support efforts to limit development on the bluffs rising above the city." These policies would protect migratory and resident bird habitats.</p>

(Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>La Riviere Park, a city of Prairie du Chien nature park does not have any free water on the 310 acre property. A series of bird baths made of satellite dishes were placed in the early 1990's by the Bluff Country Longspurs. The Longspurs are a local chapter of the National Wildlife Turkey Federation. Water to the bird baths comes from the park's watering system. In 2019 a new shelter was constructed at the park. The water system for that structure includes the water source from the bird bath system. The bird baths are replenished with water several times a day. Bird watchers now have a place to observe birds from a concealed location close to the water source.  The first bird bath to get water from the automated system received a beautification upgrade in 2020.  Flat stone landscaping was done around the raised bird bath and a long handled farm pump is now used as a port for the water delivery system.  Improvements to the bird bath system include a bird bath blind that is located along the Bird Bath Trail. This bird blind was constructed by the Prairie Rod and Gun Club. Birders can view birds coming for water or taking a bath from the concealment provided by this blind.  Maintenance of native prairie plantings and remnants in La Riviere Park and other properties in the city are conducted each year with selective cutting of encroaching trees, mowing, and burns.  Members of Saint Peter Luthern Church, ELCA, did a "God's work, our hands" project in the fall of 2022.  Youngsters and parents planted native prairie seed collected from several native prairies in  La Riviere Park.  The seed of little blue stem grass, lupine, cup plant, lavender hysop, and other prairie plants were then planted in a prairie area on St. Feriole Island to expand the amount of prairie grasslands for birds and butterflies.  The Prairie Rod and Gun Club continues to donate prairie seed to this effort.  </p>
<p>Prairie planting and maintenance continues yearly with burns and plantings as needed.  The elevated shooting tower at the La Riviere Park Archery Range, managed by the Prairie Rod and Gun Club, is a good place for birders wanting to get up in the tree tops to observe birds.  The elevated location is good for seeing warblers and other spring migrating birds.  Looking the birds in the eye is certainly better than observing the birds from ground level.   </p>

Financial support was provided by the Friends of the Sherman Swift Tower group, the Prairie Rod and Gun Club, the Prairie du Chien Rotary Club, and other donors.  Chimney Swifts continue to  use both towers for nesting and roosting sites since they were placed.    </p>
