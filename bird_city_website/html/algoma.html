The ordinance promotes new tree growth and proper grooming of trees on public and private property.  Algoma City Adminstrator Matt Murphy has completed the DNR Tree Trimming and Pruning and Safety Certification which supports the maintenance of a healthy urban forest in Algoma.  A 2017 street tree survey by Ranger Services Inc. showed that street tree planting sites are 75% stocked.  The 2017 "Street Tree Management Plan Update" and "Urban Forestry Management Plan: Parks Risk Tree Assessment" prepared by Ranger Services Inc. and funded by an Urban Forestry grant from the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Forestry Program lays out a five year tree management plan for the city including the identification of planting sites.  </p>
<p>During 2022, 250 Burr Oak trees were planted at Peterson Park, an Algoma city park which lost many trees to EAB.  Additional trees will be planted at Peterson Park in spring of 2023: 1 Eastern Red Bud; 2 Early Glow Buckeye; 2 Yellow Buckeye; 1 Cucumber Tree Magnolia; 6 Hackberry; 1 Crimson Sunset Maple; 12 Sugar Maple; 2 Sterling Silver Lindens; 5 Black Walnut; 2 Northern Catalpa; 5 Northern Yellow Birch; 7 Paper Birch; 5 White Oak; 12 Red Oak.  </p>
<p>In December of 2022 the city approved a new tree planting program.  Using Urban Forestry grant funding, the city will establish a tree replacement list for those who have a tree removed from their tree lawn. The property owner will be able to pick a tree that they would like planted and it will be planted by the City, using these grant funds, in an area agreed upon by the owner and the city. Once the tree is planted it would be the responsibility of the owner to maintain and care for the tree. The tree would belong to the property owner.  Some tree removal areas are no longer appropriate for replanting.  This program will maintain the city's urban forest by supporting planting on more appropriate sites on nearby private property.</p><br><br><strong>1.1.3, Show that the local Chamber of Commerce or a similar group (e.g., an Audubon chapter, Wild Ones, etc.) takes an active role in the planning process for protecting and enlarging favorable bird habitat</strong></strong></p><p>Crescent Beach is the 7.5 acre, 3/4 mile long Lake Michigan beach along the eastern border of the City of Algoma.  The beach is a city park.  The <a href="http://friendsofcrescentbeach.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Friends of Crescent Beach</a> (FOCB) group was organized in 2015. It is a member of the Lakeshore Natural Resource Partnership (LNRP).

<h4>Limiting or Removing Threats to Birds</h4>

<p><br><br><strong>1.2.1, Document a recent project that created or restored bird habitat in your community. (Exclusions: bird feeders and small-scale artificial nesting structures)</strong></strong></p><p>Algoma's Friends of Crescent Beach (FOCB), a member of the Lakeshore Natural Resource Partnership (LNRP) coordinated a project to restore wildlife habitat and native plants on the south end of Crescent Beach. Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. was hired with grant funds secured by LNRP to create, coordinate and implement the plan with the assistance of Algoma Parks and Recreation and Public Works Departments and volunteers organized by FOCB. The overall project goal is to stabilize the shoreline and restore a diverse natural dune habitat by controlling non-native, invasive species and establishing native vegetative cover on the southern portion of Crescent Beach. The project was initiated in 2017.  Volunteers remove invasive plants and help to plant beach grass and native shrubs.  Over 15,000 beach grass plugs have been planted as well as Juniperus communis (common juniper), Juniperus horizontalis (creeping juniper) and Dasiphora fruticose (shrubby cinquefoil). One area was also seeded with a native plant mix. The group also purchased informational signage for the restoration areas. This is an ongoing effort. In 2021 FOCB formed the volunteer Crescent Crew restoration team to maintain and continue the work based on a professionally prepared maintenance plan developed by Stantec. Crescent Crew volunteers meet weekly May through September for one hour sessions to do weeding and plantings.  Twenty-two volunteers signed up to participate for a planting event and the weekly sessions.  154 volunteer hours were recorded for 2021.  465 native flowering plants were added to the restoration area in 2021.  964 native plants were added in 2022 supported by 160 volunteer hours.</p><br><br><strong>1.2.2, Demonstrate how a public golf course is managed to benefit birds</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.3, Show that your community maximizes the value of right-of-way space (e.g., power lines, pipelines, etc.) by planting them with native grasses, shrubs, herbs, and other prairie/grassland plants</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.4, Show that a significant number of properties have been recognized as having bird-friendly yards (e.g., Yardmap/Habitat Network, National Wildlife Federation's Backyard Certification Program)</strong><br>n/a<br><br><strong>1.2.5, Provide evidence (e.g., official designation of natural areas, easements, etc.) that existing bird habitat within community limits has legal protection.

There are bird bistro gardens at the Algoma High School and Algoma Public Library as well as in residential yards. Beginning in 2020, there has been a Bird Bistro gardening project at the Algoma Community Garden where Bird City Algoma Committee member Mary Goodner has increased the diversity of native plants in the butterfly garden by adding New England Asters, Monarda, Coreopsis and Gay Feather.  Pathways were reconfigured and re-woodchipped, and in doing so, Black-eyed Susans were removed and replanted at the Algoma Library Bird Bistro, adding more diversity to that planting as well.  Bird City Algoma Committee volunteers maintain the library Bird Bistro garden area. Free native plants grown at the community garden have also been distributed to the public. Bird Bistro information is available on the Bird City Algoma website. The Bird City Algoma Committee promotes this activity with displays at community events and programming in addition to the plant give-aways. Videos of past bird friendly gardening programs are available on the Bird City Algoma website.   </p></p>
